**Odoo Forum** is a question-and-answer forum designed with providing customer support in mind.
Adding a forum to a website enables you to build a community, encourage engagement, and share
knowledge.

.. _forum/create:

Create a forum
==============

To create or edit a forum, go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Forum: Forums`. Click
:guilabel:`New` or select an existing forum and configure the following elements.

:guilabel:`Forum Name`: add the name of the forum.

:guilabel:`Mode`: select :guilabel:`Questions` to enable marking an answer as best, meaning
questions then appear as *solved*, or :guilabel:`Discussions` if the feature is not needed.

.. note::
   Regardless of the selected mode, only **one answer** per user is allowed on a single post.
   Commenting multiple times is allowed, however.

:guilabel:`Default Sort`: choose how questions are sorted by default.

  - :guilabel:`Newest`: by latest question posting date
  - :guilabel:`Last Updated`: by latest posting activity date (answers and comments included)
  - :guilabel:`Most Voted`: by highest vote tally
  - :guilabel:`Relevance`: by post relevancy (determined by a formula)
  - :guilabel:`Answered`: by likelihood to be answered (determined by a formula)

.. note::
   Users have several sorting options (total replies, total views, last activity) on the forum
   front end.

:guilabel:`Privacy`: select :guilabel:`Public` to let anyone view the forum, :guilabel:`Signed In`
to make it visible only for signed-in users, or :guilabel:`Some users` to make it visible only for a
specific user access group by selecting one :guilabel:`Authorized Group`.

Next, configure the :ref:`karma gains <forum/karma-gains>` and the :ref:`karma-related rights
<forum/karma-related-rights>`.

.. _forum/karma:

Karma points
------------

Karma points can be given to users based on different forum interactions. They can be used to
determine which forum functionalities users can access, from being able to vote on posts to
having moderator rights. They are also used to set user :ref:`ranks <forum/ranks>`.

.. important::
   - A user's karma points are shared across all forums, courses, etc., of a single Odoo website.
   - eLearning users can earn karma points through different :ref:`course interactions
     <elearning/karma>` and by :ref:`completing quizzes <elearning/content-quiz>`.
