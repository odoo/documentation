Translations
============

Congratulations! Your client has a beautifully designed homepage and contact page, and the eCommerce
is fully adapted to the Airproof design. Amazing!

Now, the client wants the website translated into French.

The easiest way to do this is:

#. | Add French to the website in the settings.
   | Enable the language switcher in the header via presets.
   .. TODO: why translate the carousel in the backend?
#. | Translate the content of the homepage carousel through the backend. 
   | But for the menu, make the translations through the frontend.
#. | Export the French :file:`.po` file for your Airproof module.
   | Place it in the :file:`/i18n` translations folder.
#. If you would like, you can add more translations directly by editing the :file:`.po` file. (using
   Poedit, your code editor, or another translation tool).

.. note::
   - Be careful when using Poedit, as it doesn't handle tags with styles well and generates an
     :file:`.mo` file.
   - To see the changes made directly via the :file:`.po` file, you will need to manually import the
     file.

Module import
=============

Great job! The website is now completely finished and your module is ready for installation in the
client's database.

Before that, test the import process on a new database.

.. tip::
   - Ensure the `base_import_module` is installed on the database before the module installation.
   - Verify all required applications are installed.
   - Skip the theme installation steps and start from scratch.
   - Manually import translations after module installation, as they won't apply automatically.
