Knowledge
=========

**Odoo Knowledge** is a multipurpose productivity app that allows internal users to enrich their
business knowledge base by providing information gathered individually or collaboratively.

The pages on which they gather content are called *articles*. They are mainly composed of a title
and a body. The latter is an HTML field containing text, images, links, records from other models,
templates, etc.

Article creation
================

Knowledge articles can be created from scratch or a pre-configured template. When an article
is created under another, the original one is the **parent article**, while the new one is called a
**child** or **nested article**, indicating its subordinate position. This structure helps organize
content by establishing clear relationships between related articles.

   To create a nested article, hover over an article in the sidebar tree and click the
   :icon:`fa-plus` :guilabel:`(plus)` icon.

Structuring

Sidebar structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

following categories:

- The :guilabel:`Workspace` category displays articles accessible to all internal users.
- The :guilabel:`Shared` category displays articles shared with specific users.

     :icon:`fa-star-o` (:guilabel:`star`) icon in the top-right menu.

Article structure

:ref:`properties <knowledge/articles_editing/properties>` are applied to a group of nested articles
under the same parent.

.. _knowledge/articles_editing/share:

Sharing

Sharing an article involves configuring :ref:`access rights <knowledge/articles_editing/rights>`,

<knowledge/articles_editing/share-online>`, and determining its visibility in the :ref:`sidebar tree
<knowledge/articles_editing/structure>`.

Articles listed under a category in the sidebar tree are **visible**. Articles that certain users
must search for through the command palette due to restricted access rights are **hidden**.
