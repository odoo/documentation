How to manage stock that you don't own?
=======================================

Introduction
============

Some suppliers can sometimes offer you to store and sell products
without having to buy those items: this technique is called **consignee
stock**.

Consignee stock is a great way for manufacturers and suppliers to launch
new products. As resellers may be reluctant to buying a product that
they are not sure to be able to sell, consignee stock will allow them to
propose an item to check its market without having to pay for it in the
first place.

Odoo has the ability to manage consignee stocks through the advanced
settings.

Configuration
=============

Open the menu :menuselection:`Inventory --> Configuration --> Settings`, 
and in the **Product Owners** section, select **Manage consignee stocks (advanced)**,
then click on **Apply**.

Reception of Consignee Stock
============================

In the Inventory's Dashboard, open the **Receipts** and create a new
reception. You can see that in the right side of the page, a new
**Owner** line has appeared. You can specify the partner which owns the
stock or leave it blank if you are the owner.
