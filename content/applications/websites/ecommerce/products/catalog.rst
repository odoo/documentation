Catalog
=======

The eCommerce catalog is the equivalent of your physical store shelves: it allows customers to see
what you have to offer. Clear categories, available options, sorting, and navigation threads help
you structure it efficiently.

.. tip::
   Go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings`, scroll down to the
   :guilabel:`Privacy` section to restrict :guilabel:`Ecommerce Access` to logged-in users and/or
   enable :guilabel:`Shared Customer Accounts` to allow access to all websites with a single
   account.

Categorize the product catalog
==============================

In Odoo, there is a **specific category model** for your eCommerce. Using eCommerce categories for
your products allows you to add a navigation menu on your eCommerce page. Visitors can then use it
to view all products under the category they select.

To do so, go to :menuselection:`Website --> eCommerce --> Products`, select the product you wish to
modify, click on the :guilabel:`Sales` tab, and select the :guilabel:`Categories` you want under
:guilabel:`eCommerce Shop`.

.. note::
   A single product can appear under multiple eCommerce categories.

When your product's categories are configured, go to your **main shop page** and click on
:menuselection:`Edit --> Customize tab`. In the :guilabel:`Categories` option, you can either enable
a menu on the :guilabel:`Left`, on the :guilabel:`Top`, or both. If you select the :guilabel:`Left`
category, the option :guilabel:`Collapsable Category Recursive` appears and allows to render the
:guilabel:`Left` category menu collapsable.

Browsing
--------

The eCommerce category is the first tool to organize and split your products. However, if you need
an extra level of categorization in your catalog, you can activate various **filters** such as
attributes or sort-by search.

Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~

Attributes refer to **characteristics** of a product, such as **color** or **material**, whereas
variants are the different combinations of attributes. :guilabel:`Attributes and Variants` can be
found under :menuselection:`Website --> eCommerce --> Products`, select your product, and
:guilabel:`Attributes & Variants` tab.

.. seealso::
   - :doc:`../../../sales/sales/products_prices/products/variants`

.. image:: catalog/catalog-attributes.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Attributes and variants of your product

To enable **attribute filtering**, go to your **main shop page**, click on :menuselection:`Edit -->
Customize tab` and select either :guilabel:`Left`, :guilabel:`Top`, or both. Additionally, you can
also enable :guilabel:`Price Filtering` to enable price filters.

.. note::
   :guilabel:`Price Filter` works independently from **attributes** and, therefore, can be enabled
   on its own if desired.

.. tip::
   You can use **attribute filters** even if you do not work with product variants. When adding
   attributes to your products, make sure only to specify *one* value per attribute. Odoo does not
   create variants if no combination is possible.

Sort-by search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to allow the user to manually **sort the catalog** using the search bar. From
your **main shop page**, click on :menuselection:`Edit --> Customize tab`; you can enable or disable
the :guilabel:`Sort-By` option as well as the :guilabel:`Layout` button. You can also select the
:guilabel:`Default Sort` of the :guilabel:`Sort-By` button. The default sort applies to *all*
categories.

The **sorting** options are:

- Featured
- Newest Arrivals
- Name (A-Z)
- Price - Low to High
- Price - High to Low

In addition, you can **manually edit** the catalog's order of a product by going to **the main shop
page** and clicking on the product. Under the :guilabel:`Product` section of the
:guilabel:`Customize` section, you can rearrange the order by clicking on the arrows. `<<` `>>` move
the product to the **extreme** right or left, and `<` `>` move the product by **one** row to the
right or left. It is also possible to change the catalog's order of products in
:menuselection:`Website --> eCommerce --> Products` and drag-and-dropping the products within the
list.

Page design
===========

Category page
-------------

You can customize the layout of the category page using the website builder.

.. important::
   Editing the layout of the category page is global; editing one category layout affects *all*
   category pages.

To do so, go on to your :menuselection:`Category page --> Edit --> Customize`. Here, you can choose
the layout, the number of columns to display the products, etc. The :guilabel:`Product Description`
button makes the product description visible from the category page, underneath the product picture.

.. image:: catalog/catalog-category-layout.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Layout options of the category pages.

.. tip::
   You can choose the size of the grid, but be aware that displaying too many products may affect
   performance and page loading speed.

Product highlight
-----------------

You can highlight products to make them more visible on the category or product page. On the page of
your choice, go to :menuselection:`Edit --> Customize` and click on the product to highlight. In the
:guilabel:`Product` section, you can choose the size of the product image by clicking on the grid,
and you can also add a **ribbon** or :guilabel:`Badge`. This displays a banner across the product's
image, such as:

- Sale;
- Sold out;
- Out of stock;
- New.

Alternatively, you can activate the :doc:`developer mode <../../../general/developer_mode>` on the
**product's template**, and under the :guilabel:`Sales` tab, change or create the ribbon from the
:guilabel:`Ribbon` field.

.. note::
   The :doc:`developer mode <../../../general/developer_mode>` is only intended for experienced
   users who wish to have access to advanced tools. Using the **developer mode** is *not*
   recommended for regular users.

Additional features
===================

You can access and enable additional feature buttons such as **add to cart**, **comparison list**,
or a **wishlist**. To do so, go to your **main shop page**, and at the end of the
:guilabel:`Products Page` category, click on the feature buttons you wish to use. All three buttons
appear when hovering the mouse over a product's image.

- :guilabel:`Add to Cart`: adds a button to
  :doc:`add the product to the cart <../checkout_payment_shipping/cart>`;
- :guilabel:`Comparison List`: adds a button to **compare** products based on their price, variant,
  etc.;
- :guilabel:`Wishlist Button`: adds a button to **wishlist** the product.

Add content
===========

You can use **building blocks** to add content on the category page, with a variety of blocks
ranging from :guilabel:`Structure` to :guilabel:`Dynamic Content`. Specific areas are defined to use
blocks are defined and highlighted on the page when **dragging-and-dropping** a block.

.. image:: catalog/catalog-content.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Building blocks areas

- If you drop a building block **on top** of the product list, it creates a new category header
  specific to *that* category.
- If you drop a building **on the top** or **bottom** of the page, it becomes visible on *all*
  category pages.

.. tip::
   Adding content to an eCommerce category page is beneficial in terms of **SEO** strategy. Using
   **keywords** linked to the products or the eCommerce categories improves organic traffic.
   Additionally, each category has its own specific URL that can be pointed to and is indexed by
   search engines.
