==============================
Service Level Agreements (SLA)
==============================

Service Level Agreements (SLA) are commitments you make with your customers to outline how a
service is delivered. It bolsters trust between you and your customers as it makes clear what
needs to be done, to what standard, and when.

Create your policies
====================

| First, enable the feature on the settings of the team you would like policies to be applied,
  going to :menuselection:`Helpdesk --> Configuration --> Helpdesk Teams`.
| Create your policies through the team’s settings page or go to :menuselection:`Helpdesk -->
  Configuration --> SLA Policies`.

| Choose to which **Team** the policy is relevant and the **Minimum Priority** a ticket needs to
  have for the policy to be applied.
| **Target** is the stage a ticket needs to reach within the period defined to satisfy the
  SLA. The period is based on the ticket’s creation date, and a deadline is set on the ticket’s form
  once it matches an SLA policy rule. If a ticket has more than one policy applied to it, the
  closest deadline of all SLAs is the one considered.
| When a ticket has satisfied an SLA policy, the SLA tag appears in green and the deadline field
  is not shown anymore.
