Create Timesheets upon Time Off Validation
==========================================

Odoo automatically timesheets on project/tasks upon time off requests. This allows for better
overall control over the validation of timesheets, as it does not leave place for forgetfulness
and questions after hours that have not been timesheeted by the employee.

Activate the :doc:`Developer mode <../../general/developer_mode/activate>`, go to *Timesheets*,
and change the *Project* and *Task* set by default, if you like.

Go to :menuselection:`Time Off --> Configuration --> Time Off Types`. Select or create the
needed type, and decide if you would like the requests to be validated or not.

| Now, once the employee has requested his time off and the request has been validated (or not,
  depending on the setting chosen), the time is automatically allocated on *Timesheets*, under the
  respective project and task.
| On the example below, the user requested *Paid Time off* from July 13th to 15th.

Considering that validation is not required, the requested time off is automatically displayed in
*Timesheets*. If validation is necessary, the time is automatically allocated after the responsible
person for validating does it so.
