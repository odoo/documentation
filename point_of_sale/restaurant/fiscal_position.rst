Using fiscal positions in PoS
=============================

In Odoo, *Fiscal Positions* let you apply different taxes based on
the customer location. In a *Point of Sale*, such as a restaurant, it can
be used to apply different taxes depending if the customer eats in or
takes away.

Set up fiscal positions for PoS
===============================

To enable this feature, go to :menuselection:`Point of Sale --> Configuration --> Point of Sale` 
and check *Fiscal Position per Order*. Now, you can choose the fiscal positions
you want for your *PoS*.

Set up a default fiscal position
================================

If you want to use a default fiscal position, meaning that a preexisting value is always 
automatically assigned, go to :menuselection:`Point of Sale --> Configuration 
--> Point of Sale` and enable *Fiscal Position*. Now, choose one to set as the default one.
