Legal framework for e-invoicing in Finland
==========================================

In Finland, businesses must comply with e-invoicing regulations to ensure secure, authentic, and
storable transactions. The primary legal framework governing e-invoicing is the `Act on Electronic
Invoicing (241/2019) <https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2019/20190241#Pidp446241968>`_, which
aligns with `EU Directive 2014/55/EU <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014L0055>`_
on electronic invoicing in public procurement. Under Finnish law, all :abbr:`B2G
(business-to-government)` transactions require the use of electronic invoices via Apix Messaging or
other Peppol-connected platforms, Finlandâ€™s standard for public sector e-invoicing. Finland is also
part of the Peppol network, ensuring interoperability and standardization for cross-border
e-invoicing within the EU. Additionally, e-invoicing is widely adopted for B2B transactions,
promoting efficient processes and improved tax compliance.

Compliance with Finnish e-invoicing regulations
===============================================

Odoo invoicing module makes it easy for businesses to adhere to Finland's e-invoicing regulations.
Here is how Odoo ensures compliance:

- **Supported formats**: Odoo supports the standardized XML in :abbr:`UBL (Universal Business
  Language)` format required for Peppol compliance. This ensures compatibility with regulations for
  sending invoices to the Finnish government, as well as sending invoices to customers and receiving
  invoices from vendors.
- **Secure storage and retrieval**: In accordance with Finnish regulations requiring businesses to
  store invoices for a minimum of seven years, Odoo securely archives all invoices in a tamper-proof
  system, allowing for easy retrieval during audits.
- **Automatic VAT calculation and reporting**: Odoo Invoicing ensures compliance with Finnish VAT
  requirements by automatically calculating and including VAT in invoices and formatting them to
  meet the legal standards for both B2B and :abbr:`B2G (business-to-government)` transactions.
