ePOS printers
=============

ePOS printers are designed to work seamlessly with Point of Sale systems. Once connected, these
devices automatically share information, allowing for direct printing of tickets from the POS system
to the ePOS printer.

Printer configuration
=====================

To use an ePos printer in Point of Sale, first set it up to get a certified domain that allows
printing from a browser.

1. Access the printer homepage by entering its IP address in a web browser.
2. Click the :guilabel:`Advanced Settings` menu.

5. Enable the :guilabel:`Automatic Update of CA-signed certificates` and :guilabel:`Update time`
   options, set a time if needed, then click :guilabel:`Next` to let the printer restart.

6. Once the printer has restarted, click the :guilabel:`Device Management` tab,
   then go to :menuselection:`Date and Time --> Time Server`.
7. Select :guilabel:`Use` in the :guilabel:`Use Time Server` field, set the
   :guilabel:`Time Server Address` field to `be.pool.ntp.org` (or any valid time server),
   and set the :guilabel:`Update Interval (min)` field to `10`.

8. Click on :guilabel:`Ok` to let the printer apply the configuration.

Odoo configuration
==================

Once the printer is set up and ready, configure it in Odoo.

#. Go to the :ref:`POS settings <configuration/settings>`, scroll down to the
   :guilabel:`Connected Devices` section, and enable the :guilabel:`ePos Printer` setting.
#. Fill in the field with your :guilabel:`ePos serial number`. Odoo will automatically compute the
   certified domain url when saving the configuration.

.. note::
   When the printer connects to a network, it automatically prints a ticket with its IP address.

   Set a time server on the printer to ensure the validity of the certificate.

   Find the :guilabel:`Administrator password` and the :guilabel:`Serial number` on the
   label at the back of your printer.
