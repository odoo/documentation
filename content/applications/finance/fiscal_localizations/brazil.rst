   be manually :doc:`installed </applications/general/apps_modules>`.

.. _localizations/brazil/loc-review:

Localization overview
=====================

The Brazilian localization package ensures compliance with Brazilian fiscal and accounting
regulations. It includes tools for managing taxes, fiscal positions, reporting, and a predefined
chart of accounts tailored to Brazil’s standards.

The Brazilian localization package provides the following key features to ensure compliance with
local fiscal and accounting regulations:

- :ref:`Chart of accounts <localizations/brazil/chart-of-accounts>`: a predefined structure tailored
  to Brazilian accounting standards
- :ref:`Taxes <localizations/brazil/taxes>`: pre-configured tax rates, including standard VAT,
  zero-rated, and exempt options.
- :doc:`Payroll </applications/hr/payroll>`
- :doc:`Reporting <../accounting/reporting>`

.. _localizations/brazil/chart-of-accounts:

Chart of accounts
-----------------

In the :doc:`chart of accounts <../accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts>`, the accounts are
mapped automatically to their corresponding taxes, and the default account payable and account
receivable fields.

.. note::
   The Brazil chart of accounts is based on the SPED CoA, which provides a baseline of the necessary
   accounts.

.. _localizations/brazil/taxes:

Taxes
-----

:doc:`Taxes <../accounting/taxes>` are automatically created and configured when installing the
Brazilian localization. Avalara uses some to compute taxes on sales orders or invoices.

Taxes used for services must be manually added and configured, as the rate may differ depending on
the city where the service is offered.

.. important::
   NFS-e can't be issued for service taxes created manually. To :ref:`electronically send an NFS-e
   <localizations/brazil/e-invoice-services>`, compute taxes using Avalara.

.. warning::
   Do not delete taxes, as they are used for the AvaTax tax computation. If deleted, Odoo creates
   them again when used in an |SO| or invoice, computing taxes with AvaTax. However, the account
   used to register the tax must be reconfigured in the tax's :guilabel:`Definition` tab, under
   the :guilabel:`Distribution for invoices` and :guilabel:`Distribution for refunds` sections.

.. _localizations/brazil/company-and-contacts:

Company and contacts
====================

To use all the features of this fiscal localization, the following fields are required on the
:doc:`company record </applications/general/companies>`:

- :guilabel:`Name`
- :guilabel:`Address`: add :guilabel:`City`, :guilabel:`State`, :guilabel:`Zip Code`,
  :guilabel:`Country`

  - In the :guilabel:`Street` field, enter the street name, number, and any additional address
    information.
  - In the :guilabel:`Street 2` field, enter the neighborhood.

- :guilabel:`Identification Number`: :guilabel:`CNPJ` or :guilabel:`CPF`
- :guilabel:`Tax ID`: associated with the identification type
- :guilabel:`IE`: State registration
- :guilabel:`IM`: Municipal registration
- :guilabel:`SUFRAMA code`: Superintendence of the Manaus Free Trade Zone - add if applicable
- :guilabel:`Phone`
- :guilabel:`Email`

Configure the :guilabel:`Fiscal Information` within the :guilabel:`Sales and Purchase` tab:

   - Add the :ref:`Fiscal Position <localizations/brazil/fiscal-positions>` for AvaTax Brazil.
   - :guilabel:`Tax Regime`: Federal Tax Regime
   - :guilabel:`ICMS Taxpayer Type`: indicates :guilabel:`ICMS regime`, :guilabel:`Exempt status`,
     or :guilabel:`Non-Taxpayer`
   - :guilabel:`Main Activity Sector`

Configure the following extra :guilabel:`Fiscal Information` to issue NFS-e:

   - Add the :ref:`Fiscal Position <localizations/brazil/fiscal-positions>` for AvaTax Brazil.
   - :guilabel:`COFINS Details`: :guilabel:`Taxable, Not Taxable, Taxable with rate 0%, Exempt,
     Suspended`
   - :guilabel:`PIS Details` :guilabel:`Taxable, Not Taxable, Taxable with rate 0%, Exempt,
     Suspended`
   - :guilabel:`CSLL Taxable` if the company is subject to CSLL or not

.. tip::
   If it is a simplified regime, the ICMS rate must be configured. To do so, go to
   :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`, scroll down to the :guilabel:`Taxes`
   section, and set the :guilabel:`Sales Tax` and :guilabel:`Purchase Tax` fields in the
   :guilabel:`Default Taxes` section.

The same configuration applies to the relevant :doc:`contact <../../essentials/contacts>` form when
using the AvaTax integration.

.. note::
   Select the :guilabel:`Company` option for a contact with a tax ID (CNPJ), or check
   :guilabel:`Individual` for a contact with a CPF.

.. _localizations/brazil/avatax-account:

AvaTax integration
==================

.. note::
   - Make sure to :ref:`install <general/install>` the :guilabel:`AvaTax Brazil` (`l10n_br_avatax`)
     module.
   - Odoo is a certified partner of Avalara Brazil.
   - The :doc:`Avalara AvaTax integration <../accounting/taxes/avatax>` uses :doc:`In-App-Purchases
     (IAPs) <../../essentials/in_app_purchase>` to compute taxes and handle electronic documents
     (e.g., :ref:`NF-e <localizations/brazil/e-invoice-goods>`, :ref:`NFS-e
     <localizations/brazil/e-invoice-services>`). Each action consumes credits from the `IAP credit
     balance <https://iap.odoo.com/iap/in-app-services/819>`_. On creation, new databases receive
     500 free credits.

To compute the goods and services tax and process electronic invoices, the following configurations
are needed:

- :ref:`Company <localizations/brazil/company-and-contacts>`
- :ref:`Contacts <localizations/brazil/company-and-contacts>`
- :ref:`AvaTax configuration<localizations/brazil/avatax-credentials>`.
- :ref:`A1 digital certificate <localizations/brazil/certificate-upload>`
- :ref:`Tax mapping <localizations/brazil/fiscal-positions>`
- :ref:`Products <localizations/brazil/products>`

.. _localizations/brazil/avatax-configuration:

Configuration
-------------

.. _localizations/brazil/avatax-credentials:

Credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Activate AvaTax in Odoo <accounting/avatax/credentials>` and, in the :guilabel:`AvaTax Brazil`
section, add the administrator's email address for the AvaTax portal in the :guilabel:`AvaTax Portal
Email` field, then click :icon:`fa-plug` :guilabel:`Create account`.

.. warning::
   When **testing** or **creating a production** :guilabel:`AvaTax Portal Email` integration in a
   sandbox or production database, use a real email address, as it is needed to :ref:`connect to
   Avalara <accounting/avatax/prerequisites>` and set up the certificates, whether to test or use it
   on production.

   There are two different Brazilian Avalara Portals:

   - One for testing: https://portal.sandbox.avalarabrasil.com.br/
   - One for production: https://portal.avalarabrasil.com.br/

   When the account is created from Odoo, select the right environment. Moreover, the email used to
   open the account cannot be used to open another account. Save the :guilabel:`API ID` and
   :guilabel:`API Key` when the account is created from Odoo.

   .. image:: brazil/transfer-api-credentials.png
      :alt: Transfer API Credentials.

After the account is created from Odoo, go to the Avalara Portal to set up the password:

#. Access the `Avalara portal <https://portal.avalarabrasil.com.br/Login>`_.
#. Click :guilabel:`Meu primeiro acesso`.
#. Add the email address used in Odoo to create the Avalara/AvaTax account, and click
   :guilabel:`Solicitar Senha`.
#. An email will then be received with a token and a link to create a password. Click on this link
   and copy-paste the token to allocate the desired password.

.. tip::
   If you use AvaTax in Odoo for tax computation **only**, setting a password or accessing the
   Avalara portal is unnecessary. However, to use the electronic invoice service, access to
   AvaTax is needed, and the :ref:`certificate must be uploaded
   <localizations/brazil/certificate-upload>`.

.. note::
   |API| credentials can be transferred. This option should be used only when an account has already
   been created in another Odoo instance and must be reused.

.. _localizations/brazil/certificate-upload:

A1 certificate upload
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To issue electronic invoices, a certificate must be uploaded to the `AvaTax portal
<https://portal.avalarabrasil.com.br/Login>`_.

The certificate will be synchronized with Odoo as long as the external identifier number in the
AvaTax portal matches, without special characters, with the CNPJ number, and the identification
number (CNPJ) in Odoo matches the CNPJ in AvaTax.

.. important::
   Some cities require the certificate to be linked within the City Portal system before issuing
   NFS-e from Odoo.

   If an error message from the city that says :guilabel:`Your certificate is not linked
   to the user` is received, this process needs to be done in the city portal.

.. _localizations/brazil/fiscal-positions:

Fiscal positions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To set up the :guilabel:`Automatic Tax Mapping (Avalara Brazil)` :ref:`fiscal position
<accounting/avatax/fiscal_positions>`, enable the :guilabel:`Detect Automatically` and
:guilabel:`Use AvaTax Brazil API` options.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`Fiscal positions <../accounting/taxes/fiscal_positions>`

.. _localizations/brazil/products:

Products
~~~~~~~~

To use the AvaTax integration on sales orders and invoices, enter the following information in the
:guilabel:`Sales` tab of the product form under the :guilabel:`Brazil Accounting` section, based on
how the product will be used.

.. _localizations/brazil/e-invoice-goods:

E-invoices for goods (NF-e)
***************************

.. important::
   The :ref:`Avalara integration <localizations/brazil/avatax-account>` works on a credit-based
   system, where each interaction with Avalara consumes one credit. Below are the main
   credit-consuming operations:

   **Sales application**

   - Tax calculation on quotations and sales orders.

   **Accounting application**

   - Tax calculation on invoices.
   - Electronic invoice submission (NF-e or NFS-e).

   **Occasional operations**: (each step is billed separately)

   - :ref:`Correction letter (Carta de Correção) <localizations/brazil/correction-letter>`
   - :ref:`Invoice cancellation <localizations/brazil/invoice-cancellation>`
   - :ref:`Sales refund via credit note <localizations/brazil/credit-notes>`
   - :ref:`Sales complementary invoice via debit note <localizations/brazil/debit-notes>`
   - :ref:`Invoice number range invalidation <localizations/brazil/invoice-number-invalidation>`
   - Other tax validations.

.. note::
   If taxes are calculated in the **Sales** app, and the invoice is later issued in the
   **Accounting** app, the calculation happens twice, consuming two credits.

.. example::
   | **Sales order confirmed**
   | :icon:`fa-arrow-down` 1 credit (tax calculation)
   | **Invoice created**
   | :icon:`fa-arrow-down` 1 credit (tax calculation)
   | **Invoice confirmed and submitted**

.. note::
   Odoo automatically creates three products to be used for transportation costs associated with
   sales. These are named :guilabel:`Freight`, :guilabel:`Insurance`, and :guilabel:`Other Costs`
   and are already configured. If more need to be created, duplicate and use the same configuration:

   - :guilabel:`Product Type` :guilabel:`Service`
   - :guilabel:`Transportation Cost Type`: :guilabel:`Insurance`, :guilabel:`Freight`, or
     :guilabel:`Other Costs`

.. _localizations/brazil/electronic-documents:

Electronic documents
--------------------

.. _localizations/brazil/journals:

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A *series* number is linked to a sequence number range for electronic invoices. To configure the
series number on a sales journal, go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals`
and set it in the :guilabel:`Series` field. If more than one series is needed, a new sales journal
must be created, and a new series number must be assigned for each series.

Enable the :guilabel:`Use Documents?` option as the :guilabel:`Series` field will only be displayed
if the :guilabel:`Use Documents?` option is selected on the journal.

When issuing electronic and non-electronic invoices, the :guilabel:`Type` field selects the document
type used when creating the invoice.

.. note::
   When creating the journal, ensure the :guilabel:`Dedicated Credit Note Sequence` field in the
   :guilabel:`Accounting Information` section is unchecked, as in Brazil, sequences between
   invoices, credit notes, and debit notes are shared per series number, which means per journal.

.. _localizations/brazil/customer-invoices:

Customer invoices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To process an electronic invoice for goods (NF-e) or services (NFS-e), the invoice must be confirmed
and taxes must be computed by Avalara. The following fields must be filled out:

- :guilabel:`Customer`, with all customer information
- :guilabel:`Payment Method: Brazil`: Specify the expected payment method.
- :guilabel:`Document Type`: Select :guilabel:`(55) Electronic Invoice (NF-e)` or :guilabel:`(SE)
  Electronic Service Invoice (NFS-e)`.

:guilabel:`Other Info` tab:

- :guilabel:`Fiscal Position` set as :guilabel:`Automatic Tax Mapping (Avalara Brazil)`.

Some optional fields depend on the nature of the transaction. These fields in the :guilabel:`Other
Info` tab are not required, so in most cases, leaving them blank will not result in errors from the
government when the invoice is submitted:

- :guilabel:`Freight Model` determines how the goods are planned to be transported - domestic.
- :guilabel:`Transporter Brazil` determines who is doing the transportation.

Then, click :guilabel:`Send`. In the :guilabel:`Print & Send` window, click :guilabel:`Process
e-invoice` and any other options, such as :guilabel:`Download` or :guilabel:`Email`. Finally, click
:guilabel:`Send` to process the invoice with the government.

.. note::
   All fields available on the invoice used to issue an electronic invoice are also available on the
   sales order, if needed. When creating the first invoice, the :guilabel:`Document Number` field is
   displayed and allocated as the first number to be used sequentially for subsequent invoices.

.. _localizations/brazil/credit-notes:

Credit notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a sales return needs to be registered, a :ref:`credit note can be created in Odoo
<accounting/credit_notes/issue-credit-note>` and sent to the government for validation.

.. note::
   Credit notes are only available for electronic invoices for goods (NF-e).

.. _localizations/brazil/debit-notes:

Debit notes
~~~~~~~~~~~

If additional information needs to be included or values that were not accurately provided in the
original invoice need to be corrected, a :ref:`debit note can be issued
<accounting/credit_notes/issue-debit-note>`.

.. note::
   - Debit notes are only available for electronic invoices for goods (NF-e).
   - Only the products included in the original invoice can be included in the debit note. While
     changes can be made to the product's unit price or quantity, products **cannot** be added to
     the debit note. The purpose of this document is only to declare the amount to be added to the
     original invoice for the same or fewer products.

.. _localizations/brazil/invoice-cancellation:

Invoice cancellation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to cancel an electronic invoice that the government validated.

.. note::
   Check whether the electronic invoice is still within the cancellation deadline, which may vary
   according to each state's legislation.

.. _localizations/brazil/e-invoice-goods-nf-e:

E-invoices for goods (NF-e)
***************************

To cancel an e-invoice for goods (NF-e) in Odoo, click :guilabel:`Request Cancel` and add a
cancellation :guilabel:`Reason` on the pop-up that appears. To send this cancellation reason to the
customer via email, enable the :guilabel:`E-mail` checkbox.

.. note::
   This is an electronic cancellation, which means that Odoo will send a request to the government
   to cancel the NF-e. It will then consume one |IAP| credit, as an |API| call occurs.

.. _localizations/brazil/e-invoice-services-nf-e:

E-invoices for services (NFS-e)
*******************************

To cancel an e-invoice for services (NFS-e) in Odoo, click :guilabel:`Request Cancel`. There is no
electronic cancellation process in this case, as not every city has this service available. The
user needs to cancel this NFS-e on the city portal manually. Once that step is completed, they can
request the cancellation in Odoo, which will cancel the invoice.

.. _localizations/brazil/correction-letter:

Correction letter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A correction letter can be created and linked to an electronic invoice for goods (NF-e) that the
government validated.

To do so in Odoo, click :guilabel:`Correction Letter` and add a correction :guilabel:`Reason` to the
pop-up. To send the correction reason to a customer via email, enable the :guilabel:`E-mail`
checkbox.

.. note::
   Correction letters are only available for electronic invoices for goods (NF-e).

.. _localizations/brazil/invoice-number-invalidation:

Invoice number range invalidation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A range of sequences that are assigned to sales journals can be invalidated by the government if
they are not currently used **and** will not be used in the future. To do so, go to
:menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals`, open the journal, click the
:icon:`fa-cog` (gear) icon, and select :guilabel:`Invalidate Number Range (BR)`. On the
:guilabel:`Invalidate Number Range (BR)` wizard, add the :guilabel:`Initial Number` and
:guilabel:`End Number` of the range that should be cancelled, and enter an invalidation
:guilabel:`Reason`.

.. note::
   - Invoice number range invalidation is only available for electronic invoices for goods (NF-e).
   - The journal's chatter records the log of the cancelled numbers, along with the XML file.

.. _localizations/brazil/vendor-bills:

Vendor bills
------------

When receiving an invoice from a supplier, encode the bill in Odoo by adding all the commercial
information and the same Brazilian-specific information recorded on the :ref:`customer invoices
<localizations/brazil/electronic-documents>`.

These Brazilian-specific fields are:

- :guilabel:`Payment Method: Brazil`: Specify the expected payment method.
- :guilabel:`Document Type`: used by the vendor
- :guilabel:`Document Number`: the invoice number from the supplier
- :guilabel:`Freight Model`: **NF-e specific** how goods are planned to be transported - domestic
- :guilabel:`Transporter Brazil`: **NF-e specific** who is doing the transportation.

.. _localizations/brazil/pos:

Point of sale NFC-e
===================

The NFC-e is a legal document that supports selling goods or merchandise to the final customer. Like
the :ref:`NF-e <localizations/brazil/e-invoice-goods-nf-e>`, the electronic customer invoice is also
issued in XML file format and has an auxiliary document (DANFC-e) known as the *NFC-e Summary*. This
electronic document can be issued through **Odoo Point of Sale**.

Its legal validity is guaranteed by the digital signature and by each Brazilian state's SEFAZ
(Secretaria da Fazenda).

.. important::
   The :ref:`Avalara integration <localizations/brazil/avatax-account>` operates on a credit-based
   system. Each operation that involves communication with Avalara consumes one credit. The
   following operations within the **Point of Sale** (POS) application are subject to credit
   consumption:

   - Tax calculation at the time of sale
   - Electronic invoice issuance (NFC-e)

.. note::
   Each step is billed separately. For example, calculating taxes and issuing an invoice for the
   same POS transaction consumes two credits.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`Point of Sale <../../sales/point_of_sale>`

.. _localizations/brazil/pos-configuration:

Configuration
-------------

:ref:`Install <general/install>` the :guilabel:`Brazilian Accounting EDI for POS` (`l10nbr_edi_pos`)
module and make sure to activate :doc:`AvaTax <../accounting/taxes/avatax>`.

.. _localizations/brazil/pos-csc-details:

CSC details
-----------

Go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings` and scroll to the :guilabel:`Taxes`
section. In the :guilabel:`NFC-e configuration` section, complete the following CSC (Taxpayer
Security Code) fields:

- :guilabel:`CSC ID`: The *CSC ID* or *CSC Token* is an identification of the taxpayer security
  code, which can have 1 to 6 digits and is available on the official website of your state’s
  Department of Finance (SEFAZ).
- :guilabel:`CSC Number`: The *CSC Number* is a code of up to 36 characters that only you and the
  Department of Finance know. It is used to generate the QR Code of the NFC-e and ensure the

Generating an NFC-e
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To generate an NFC-e, follow these steps:

#. :ref:`Open the relevant point of sale shop and make a sale <pos/open-register>`.
#. Validate the payment to calculate taxes and issue an NFC-e. The valid NFC-e appears on the right
   side of the screen.

   :alt: NFC-e Success in a POS session.

.. note::
   It is also possible to issue an NFC-e that identifies the customer by their CPF/CNPJ. To do
   so, click :icon:`fa-user` :guilabel:`Customer`, search for the customer, or create a new one.

   The following are mandatory fields to issue a CPF/CNPJ identified NFC-e:

   - :guilabel:`Name`
   - :guilabel:`City` and :guilabel:`State` where the invoice is being issued
   - :guilabel:`CPF/CNPJ`

#. Click :guilabel:`Validate`. The NFC-e appears, highlighting the customer's CPF on the print.
#. Click :guilabel:`Print` or :guilabel:`Send via e-mail` to deliver the invoice to the customer.

.. _localizations/brazil/nfc-e-print:

NFC-e ticket print
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After :ref:`generating and validating the NFC-e <localizations/brazil/generate-nfc-e>`, click
:guilabel:`Print` to deliver the invoice.

.. note::
   The Odoo NFC-e feature is compatible with any thermal printer and does not require an :doc:`Odoo
   IoT Box <../../general/iot>`.

.. _localizations/brazil/order-with-nfc-e-error:

Re-issuing a PoS order with an NFC-e error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the NFC-e returns an error, follow these steps:

#. Correct the error.
#. Re-issue the NFC-e by clicking the :icon:`fa-bars` :guilabel:`(menu)` icon and selecting
   :guilabel:`Orders`.
#. Filter the list to show only :guilabel:`Paid` orders and click :guilabel:`Details`. The error is
   displayed.
#. Click :guilabel:`Send NFC-e`.

.. note::
   If the error has been corrected and the PoS session is closed, Odoo logs the tax adjustment in
   the chatter of the related journal entry. The journal entry for the order indicates that the
   taxes were incorrectly calculated. In this case, reprocessing the NFC-e is required.

.. _localizations/brazil/nfc-e-refunds-cancellations:

NFC-e refunds & cancellations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Refunds can be processed directly in Odoo <pos/refund>`, but *cancellations* must be performed
through the official government portal.

When the process is finalized, the approved return NF-e is created, meaning the **previous NFC-e is
canceled**.

.. image:: brazil/l10n-br-return-succeed.png
   :alt: Return of Goods NF-e Approved.

.. important::
   SEFAZ only allows cancellation of an NFC-e **within 30 minutes** of its issuance on the SEFAZ
   website. After this period, a manual refund must be processed, along with the issuance of a
   *Return of Goods NF-e*.
