Batch payments by bank deposit
==============================

A **batch deposit** is a convenient way to group customer payments and deposit them into your bank

batch reference. This reference can be used when reconciling to match bank statement lines with
transactions in the batch deposit.

Configuration
=============

Go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Customer Payments` and tick
:guilabel:`Batch Payments` to activate the feature.
