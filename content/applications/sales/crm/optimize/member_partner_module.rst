Membership / Partnership module
===============================

The Membership / Partnership module allows for the creation and sale of memberships. Memberships can
be sold through both sales orders and subscriptions products so that businesses can organize and
interact with customers as members. This allows for:

- measuring membership activity, inactivity, sign ups, and churn rates
- viewing membership renewals and expirations
- following up on membership dues and associated payments
- communicating with members, including sending email blasts based on members' current status
- assigning different membership levels to members
- organizing members-only events
- creating membership lists populated with contact info and other details about members.

The Membership / Partnership module vs. the Membership app
==========================================================

Beginning with 19.0, the **Membership** app has been replaced by the Membership / Partnership
module. This module captures all of the functionality of the **Membership** app, but in a module
that is better integrated with other essential apps without requiring a specific **Accounting**
module. This replacement does not break any existing membership information when upgrading to 19.0.

App integrations with the Membership / Partnership module
=========================================================

Once activated, the Membership / Partnership module is fully integrated with both the **Sales** and
**Subscriptions** apps. The module is also compatible with the **eCommerce** app, allowing customers
to purchase memberships through business's websites.

Finally, the Membership / Partnership module is compatible with pricelists both before and after
sales. Price rules can be set before memberships are sold and applied after they are active.

Activating the new module
=========================

The Memberships / Partnerships module can be activated within the **CRM** app. To activate the
Memberships / Partnerships module, go to :menuselection:`CRM app --> Configuration --> Settings`. In
the :guilabel:`CRM` section, check the :guilabel:`Membership / Partnership` box to activate the
module. The name given to affiliates can also be customized. By default, it is set to `Members`.
