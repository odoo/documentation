   .. note::
      - Clicking this icon displays the number of orders at each stage: :guilabel:`New`,
        :guilabel:`Ongoing`, and :guilabel:`Done`.
      - The :guilabel:`New` button indicates newly placed orders, :guilabel:`Ongoing` is for
        accepted orders, and :guilabel:`Done` is for orders ready to be delivered.

Then,

#. Select the desired order.
#. Click the :guilabel:`Accept` button.
#. When an order is accepted, its :guilabel:`Order Status` switches from :guilabel:`Placed` to
   :guilabel:`Acknowledged` and is automatically displayed on the preparation display.

When the order is ready,

#. Open the orders' list view.
#. Select the order.
#. Click the :guilabel:`Mark as ready` button. Its :guilabel:`Order Status` switches from
   :guilabel:`Acknowledged` to :guilabel:`Food Ready`, and its :guilabel:`Status` switches from
   :guilabel:`Ongoing` to :guilabel:`Paid`.

Order rejection
---------------

Sometimes, the shop or restaurant may want to **reject** an order. In this case, open the orders'
list view,

#. Select the desired order.
#. Click the :guilabel:`Reject` button.
#. Select one of the reasons from the popup window.

.. important::
   **Swiggy** orders cannot be directly rejected. Attempting to reject one prompts Swiggy customer
   support to contact the restaurant. Similarly, **Deliveroo**, **JustEat**, and **HungerStation**
   do not allow order rejection. Always follow the respective provider's guidelines for handling
   such cases.
