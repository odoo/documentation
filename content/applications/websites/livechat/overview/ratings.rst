Ratings
=======

Giving users the opportunity to rate their interactions can help you improving the experience you
offer. That means staying on top of your customers' needs, besides keeping track of your operators’
performances.

Customer Rating
===============

| Once the user chooses to close the chat window, he can rate his interaction.
| If the user is *Not satisfied* or *Highly dissatisfied*, a field allowing for an explanation
  is shown.
| A copy of the conversation can also be sent by email.
