Subcontract the manufacturing
=============================

Some businesses subcontract the production of some finished products
through subcontractors. This can be easily managed through Odoo.

Configuration
=============

Go to the :menuselection:`Manufacturing app --> Configuration --> Settings` and tick the
box *Subcontracting*.

You can now define subcontracted *Bill of Materials*. Therefore, you need to go to
:menuselection:`Manufacturing --> Master Data --> Bill of Materials` and hit *Create*. In this
*BoM*, list the components which will be used by the subcontractor to manufacture the subcontracted
finished product. Specify that the *BoM* type is *Subcontracting*.

You can also define subcontractors on the BoM.

-  If no subcontractor is set, the BoM can be used by any subcontractor

-  If some are set, the BoM can only be used for those subcontractors

Receive or buy a subcontracted product
======================================

You have two options to trigger the subcontracting of a product:

-  **Option A**: You can buy the subcontracted product from your subcontractor

-  **Option B**: You can directly receive the subcontracted product

Let’s start with option A (option B is just a simpler version of it).

Create a new purchase order. The vendor must be a subcontractor. The
unit price should be the cost you are paying to the subcontractor for
the subcontracting (thus, it’s not necessarily the total cost of the
subcontracted product).

The validation of the purchase order automatically creates the receipt.
Whenever you receive the product, you can validate the receipt. The
following stock moves are created:

-  For the components

   -  From Subcontracting To Production

-  For the subcontracted product

   -  From Production to Subcontracting

   -  From Subcontracting to Stock

The *Subcontracting Location* represents the place where the products
are at your subcontractor’s warehouse. It is configured as an internal
location, the components that are sent to the subcontractor are still
valued in your stock.

For option B, you can simply create the receipt manually with a partner
of type subcontractor defined on it.

Resupply the subcontractor with the components
==============================================

There are 3 ways to manage the resupply of your subcontractor with the
components:

-  **Manually**: You create a delivery order in which you set the
       subcontractor as a partner and you choose the components to
       deliver.

-  **With reordering rules**: You can define a *reordering rule*
       on the *Subcontracting location* to ensure that they are always
       enough components sent to your subcontractors. When the
       reordering rule is triggered, a delivery order is created for the
       product is automatically created.

-  **On order**: You can also deliver the components to your
       subcontractors each time you order a subcontracted product. For
       this, you need to tick the route *Resupply Subcontractor on
       Order* on the wanted components.
