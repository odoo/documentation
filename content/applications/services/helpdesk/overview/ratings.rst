Ratings
=======

Allow customers to rate their experience with your helpdesk teams to strengthen your credibility and
gain their trust. Reviews can also influence a customer’s decision and open space for feedback that
can help you improve the quality of your services.

Set up
======

Go to :menuselection:`Helpdesk --> Configuration --> Helpdesk Teams` and enable *Ratings on
tickets*. The feature automatically adds a default email template on the non-folded *closing
stage(s)* of that team.

helpdesk team and click on *Settings*, then on *Edit Stage*.
