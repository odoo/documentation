PoS product categories
======================

Configuration
-------------

POS product categories allow users to categorize products and get a more structured and clean
POS interface.

To manage PoS categories, go to :menuselection:`Point of Sale --> Configuration --> PoS Product
Categories`. To add a new category, click :guilabel:`Create`. Then, name it in the
:guilabel:`Category Name` field.

To associate a category with a parent category, fill in the :guilabel:`Parent Category` field. A
parent category groups one or more child categories.

Go to :menuselection:`Point of Sale --> Products --> Products` and open a product form. Then, go to
the :guilabel:`Sales` tab and fill in the :guilabel:`Category` field under the :guilabel:`Point of
Sale` section.
