PDF reports
===========

With Studio, you can :ref:`edit existing PDF reports <studio/pdf-reports/edit>` (e.g., invoices,
quotations, etc.) or :ref:`create new ones <studio/pdf-reports/edit>`.

.. _studio/pdf-reports/default-layout:

Default layout
==============

The default layout of reports is managed outside Studio. Go to :menuselection:`Settings`, then, in
the :guilabel:`Companies` section of the main page, click :guilabel:`Configure Document Layout`.
Layout settings are company-specific but apply to all reports.

.. tip::
   You can see how the different settings affect the report layout in the report preview on the
   right side of the :guilabel:`Configure your document layout` window. When creating or editing a
   report, you can see a preview of the report by clicking :guilabel:`Print preview` on the left
   side of the screen.

Use the following settings:

.. _studio/pdf-reports/default-layout-layout:

- :guilabel:`Layout`: Seven layouts are available:

  .. tabs::

     .. tab:: Light

        .. image:: pdf_reports/layout-light.png
           :alt: Light report layout sample
           :scale: 90%

        .. image:: pdf_reports/layout-folder.png
           :alt: Folder report layout sample
           :scale: 90%

.. _studio/pdf-reports/default-layout-background:

- :guilabel:`Background`: The following backgrounds are available:

  - :guilabel:`Blank`: Nothing is displayed.
  - :guilabel:`Demo logo`: A demo logo is displayed in the background.
  - :guilabel:`Custom`: Upload a custom background image.

.. _studio/pdf-reports/default-layout-font:

- :guilabel:`Text`: Eight fonts are available: Lato, Roboto, Open Sans, Montserrat, Oswald,
  Raleway, Tajawal (which supports Arabic and Latin scripts), and Fira Mono. Go to the `Google Fonts
  website <https://fonts.google.com/>`_ to preview them.

.. _studio/pdf-reports/default-layout-logo:

- :guilabel:`Company logo`: Click the :guilabel:`Edit` button to upload or change the logo. This
  adds the logo to the companyâ€™s record on the *Company* model, which you can access by going to
  :menuselection:`Settings` and then clicking :guilabel:`Update Info` in the :guilabel:`Companies`
  section.

.. _studio/pdf-reports/default-layout-colors:

- :guilabel:`Colors`: Change the primary and secondary colors used to structure reports. The default
  colors are automatically generated based on the colors of the logo.

.. _studio/pdf-reports/default-layout-address:

- :guilabel:`Address`: The company name and address are displayed in the header of :ref:`external
  reports <studio/pdf-reports/header-footer>`. You can add multiple lines of text.

.. _studio/pdf-reports/default-layout-tagline:

- :guilabel:`Tagline`: This is displayed in the header of :ref:`external reports
  <studio/pdf-reports/header-footer>` using the Light, Striped, Bubble, Wave and Folder
  layouts and in the footer of external reports using the Boxed and Bold layouts. You
  can add multiple lines of text.

.. _studio/pdf-reports/default-layout-footer:

- :guilabel:`Footer`: This text is used in the footer of :ref:`external reports
  <studio/pdf-reports/header-footer>`. You can add multiple lines of text. You can also
  edit the footer using the :ref:`report editor <studio/pdf-reports/edit>`.

.. _studio/pdf-reports/default-layout-paper:

- :guilabel:`Paper format`: This defines the default paper size of reports. You can select
  :guilabel:`A4` (21 cm x 29.7 cm) and :guilabel:`US Letter` (21.59 cm x 27.54 cm). This can also be
  defined for individual reports in the :guilabel:`Paper format` field in
  :ref:`Studio <studio/pdf-reports/edit-options>`.

  .. note::
     Other paper formats may be available depending on which apps or modules you have installed, for
     example, label sheets for the Inventory app or event badges for the Events app.

.. _studio/pdf-reports/create:

Creating new PDF reports
========================

To create a new report for a :doc:`model </applications/studio/models_modules_apps>`,
(e.g., sales orders) access the model, click the :icon:`oi-studio` (:guilabel:`Toggle Studio`)
button, then click :guilabel:`Reports`. Click :guilabel:`New` and, in the popup window that opens,
select the type of report. This is solely used to determine what is displayed in the header and
footer:

.. _studio/pdf-reports/header-footer:

- :guilabel:`External`:

  - The header displays the company's :ref:`logo <studio/pdf-reports/default-layout-logo>` and its
    :ref:`name and address <studio/pdf-reports/default-layout-address>`. For reports using the
    Light, Striped, Bubble, Wave and Folder layouts, the
    :ref:`tagline <studio/pdf-reports/default-layout-tagline>` also appears in the header.

  - The footer displays the values set in the
    :ref:`Footer <studio/pdf-reports/default-layout-footer>` field and the page number. For
    reports using the Boxed and Bold layouts, the
    :ref:`tagline <studio/pdf-reports/default-layout-tagline>` also appears in the footer.

- :guilabel:`Internal`: The header displays the user's current date and time, the company's
  :ref:`name and address <studio/pdf-reports/default-layout-address>` and the page number. There is
  no footer.

- :guilabel:`Blank`: There is neither a header nor a footer. Click in the upper left corner of the
  page to edit the report.

Once you have created the report, you can start :ref:`editing it <studio/pdf-reports/edit>`.

.. _studio/pdf-reports/edit:

Editing PDF reports
===================

To access the reports available for a model, access the model, click the
:icon:`oi-studio` (:guilabel:`Toggle Studio`) button, then click :guilabel:`Reports`. Select an
existing report to open it.

Alternatively, you can also open Studio, click :guilabel:`Reports`, and search for a specific
report or model.

.. important::
   It is strongly recommended to **duplicate** the standard report and make changes in the
   duplicated version. To duplicate a report, hover the mouse pointer on the top right corner
   of the report, click the :icon:`fa-ellipsis-vertical` (:guilabel:`vertical ellipsis`) icon, and
   then select :guilabel:`Duplicate`.

   .. image:: pdf_reports/duplicate-report.png
      :alt: Duplicating a PDF report

.. _studio/pdf-reports/edit-options:

Options
-------

Once you have selected or created a report, you can use the options in the left part of the screen
to:

- Change the :guilabel:`Report name`: The new name is applied everywhere (in Studio, in the
  :guilabel:`Print` menu under the :icon:`fa-cog` (:guilabel:`gear`) icon in the form view, and in
  the PDF file name).
- Modify the :guilabel:`Paper format`: If no value is selected, the format defined in the
  :ref:`default layout <studio/pdf-reports/default-layout-paper>` is used.
- :guilabel:`Show in print menu`: to add the report to the :guilabel:`Print` menu in the form view.
- :guilabel:`Reload from attachment`: to save the report as an attachment on the record the first
  time it is generated and reload the original version of the report any subsequent time. This is
  legally required for invoices and is mainly used in this case.
- :guilabel:`Limit visibility to groups`: to limit the availability of the PDF report to specific
  :doc:`user groups <../general/users/access_rights>`.
- :guilabel:`Edit sources`: to modify the report directly in the :ref:`XML file
  <studio/pdf-reports/XML-editing>`.
- :guilabel:`Reset report`: to discard all changes made to the report and reset it to its standard
  version.
- :guilabel:`Print preview`: to generate and download a report preview.

.. _studio/pdf-reports/report-editor:

Report editor
-------------

The report editor allows you to modify the content and formatting of the report.

.. tip::
  - You can :guilabel:`Undo` or :guilabel:`Redo` changes using the related buttons or the shortcuts
    `CTRL` + `Z` and `CTRL` + `Y`.

  - Changes are saved automatically when you leave the report or manually using the
    :guilabel:`Save` button.

  - You can reset the report to its standard version by clicking the :guilabel:`Reset report` button
    in the left part of the screen.

.. important::
   Editing the header and footer of a report impacts all standard and custom reports.

Conditional blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dashed rectangles represent **conditional blocks** (*if/else* statements). These are used to
show/hide content based on specific conditions. Click on the block to view the conditions.

.. image:: pdf_reports/conditional-block-if.png
   :alt: View conditions applied to a block.

Select a value to preview its corresponding output and edit it if necessary.

.. image:: pdf_reports/conditional-block-else.png
   :alt: Preview the output of another condition.

.. note::
   Conditions can only be edited in the :ref:`XML <studio/pdf-reports/XML-editing>`.

Other content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two types of text content in reports:

- Static text, i.e., the text that is not highlighted in blue, which can be modified directly in the
  editor.
- Dynamic text, i.e., the text that is highlighted in blue, which is replaced by
  :doc:`field </applications/studio/fields>` values when the report is generated, e.g., the sales order number or
  the quotation date.

You can add content (e.g., fields, lists, tables, images, banners, etc.) to the report using
commands. Type `/` to open the :ref:`powerbox <essentials/html_editor/commands>`, then type the
command's name or select it from the list.

To add static text to the report, type the text where you want it.

For more advanced changes, you can :ref:`edit the report in the XML directly
<studio/pdf-reports/XML-editing>`.

.. _studio/pdf-reports/add-field:

Add a field
***********

To add a field, type `/` and select the :guilabel:`Field` command. In the list that opens, select
or search for the field; click the right arrow next to the field name to access the list of related
fields if needed. Then, specify the default value that will be shown if the field is not completed
in the record and press `Enter`.

.. image:: pdf_reports/powerbox-field.png
   :alt: Select a related field.

.. _studio/pdf-reports/add-edit-table:

Add or edit a table
*******************

There are two types of tables in reports:

- :ref:`Static tables <studio/pdf-reports/static-table>`, which are used to display static text or fields. For this type of table, you define
  the number of columns and rows when adding the table.
- :ref:`Dynamic tables <studio/pdf-reports/dynamic-table>`, which are used to display data from
  :ref:`relational fields <studio/fields/relational-fields>`.
  For this type of table, you only define the number of columns when adding the table. The number
  of rows in the generated report will be determined by the number of records in the related model
  that are linked with the current model.

  .. example::
     In a sales order report, a dynamic table is used to show the order lines related to the sales
     order. If the sales order contains 10 order lines, the table in the generated report has 10 rows;
     if it contains two order lines, the table has two rows.

.. _studio/pdf-reports/static-table:

Add or edit a static table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add a static table, type `/` and select the :guilabel:`Table` command. Determine the number of
columns and rows for the table. Once the table has been added, you can start editing it.

You can insert, move and delete columns and rows using the table tools. Position the cursor on top
of the column or to the left of the row then click the purple rectangle and select an option.

.. image:: pdf_reports/table-tools.png
   :alt: List of available options for editing table structure.

To resize a column, drag the column border to the desired position; reset all columns
to their standard size by selecting :guilabel:`Reset Size` from the table tools.

Add the :ref:`field of your choice <studio/pdf-reports/add-field>` in a cell or add static text
by typing.

.. tip::
   To add text in a structured way without using a table, you can use columns. Add columns by
   typing `/` and selecting the appropriate command: :guilabel:`2 columns`, :guilabel:`3 columns` or
   :guilabel:`4 columns`.

.. _studio/pdf-reports/dynamic-table:

Add or edit a dynamic table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  .. note::
     - Only relations of type `one2many` or `many2many` can be displayed as dynamic tables.
     - An existing dynamic table in a standard report has a more complex structure than a dynamic table
       you add yourself. For such tables, it is possible to insert or delete columns; it is not possible
       to move columns or to insert, move or delete rows.

To add a dynamic table, type `/` and select the :guilabel:`Dynamic Table` command. In the list that
opens, select or search for the relation the table will be based on and press `Enter`. Once the
table has been added, you can start editing it.

You can insert, move and delete columns using the table tools, as for a
:ref:`static table <studio/pdf-reports/static-table>`. It is also possible to insert static rows
that will appear above or below the generated rows.

To add a field to a cell, delete any placeholder text then add the :ref:`field of your choice
<studio/pdf-reports/add-field>`. The dialog box that opens shows the source object for the
field (e.g., the *Order Lines* model) and the list of available fields.

.. image:: pdf_reports/available-fields.png
   :alt: List of available fields for the sale order lines model.

Replace the :guilabel:`Column name` label by the label of your choice.

.. note::
   The default row automatically iterates over the field's content, generating a row on the report
   for each field value (e.g., one row per order line).

Formatting
**********

To format text in the report, select it, then format it using the options in the
:doc:`text editor </applications/essentials/html_editor>`.

  .. image:: pdf_reports/text-editor.png
     :alt: Format text using the text editor.

.. _studio/pdf-reports/XML-editing:

Editing the report's XML
------------------------

.. warning::
   Modifying the XML directly may result in report issues during :doc:`upgrades
   <../../../administration/upgrade>`. If this happens, simply copy your changes from the old
   database into your upgraded database.

To edit the report's XML, click :guilabel:`Edit sources` in the left pane.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

.. spoiler:: Modify the widget of a field

   To change how data is presented in your report, you can modify a field's default
   :doc:`widget </applications/studio/fields>` manually. In the example below, the order date shows
   the date and time by default, while the unit price defaults to a precision of two decimal
   places.

   .. code-block:: xml
      :emphasize-lines: 2,3

      <div class="oe_structure">
       <span t-field="doc.date_order"/>
       <span t-field="doc.price_unit"/>
      </div>

  By using `t-options`, in this case the `widget` option, these fields can be modified to show
  only the date and a precision of four decimal places, respectively:

   .. code-block:: xml
      :emphasize-lines: 2,3

      <div class="oe_structure">
       <span t-field="doc.date_order" t-options="{'widget': 'date'}"/>
       <span t-field="doc.price_unit" t-options="{'widget': 'float', 'precision': 4}"/>
      </div>

.. spoiler:: Conditional blocks

   If you want to show/hide content based on specific conditions, you can manually add `if/else`
   control statements in the report XML.

   For example, if you want to hide a custom data table if there are no tags, you can use the `t-if`
   attribute to define the condition, which is then evaluated as `True` or `False`. The table will
   not be displayed if there are no tags in the quotation.

   .. code-block:: xml
      :emphasize-lines: 2

      <!-- table root element -->
      <table class="table" t-if="len(doc.tag_ids) > 0">
          <!-- thead = table header, the row with column titles -->
          <thead>
              <!-- table row element -->
              <tr>
                  <!-- table header element -->
                  <th>ID</th>
                  <th>Name</th>
              </tr>
          </thead>
          <!-- table body, the main content -->
          <tbody>
              <!-- we create a row for each subrecord with t-foreach -->
              <tr t-foreach="doc.tag_ids" t-as="tag">
                  <!-- for each line, we output the name and price as table cells -->
                  <td t-out="tag.id"/>
                  <td t-out="tag.name"/>
              </tr>
          </tbody>
      </table>

   If you want to display another block in case the `t-if` statement is evaluated as `False`, you
   can specify it using the `t-else` statement. The `t-else` block must directly follow the `t-if`
   block in the document structure. There is no need to specify any condition in the `t-else`
   attribute. As an example, let's show a quick message explaining that there are no tags on the
   quotation:

   .. code-block:: xml
      :emphasize-lines: 22

      <!-- table root element -->
      <table class="table" t-if="len(doc.tag_ids) > 0">
          <!-- thead = table header, the row with column titles -->
          <thead>
              <!-- table row element -->
              <tr>
                  <!-- table header element -->
                  <th>ID</th>
                  <th>Name</th>
              </tr>
          </thead>
          <!-- table body, the main content -->
          <tbody>
              <!-- we create a row for each subrecord with t-foreach -->
              <tr t-foreach="doc.tag_ids" t-as="tag">
                  <!-- for each line, we output the name and price as table cells -->
                  <td t-out="tag.id"/>
                  <td t-out="tag.name"/>
              </tr>
          </tbody>
      </table>
      <div class="text-muted" t-else="">No tag present on this document.</div>

   By using the `t-if/t-else` notation, the report editor recognizes that these sections are
   mutually exclusive and should be displayed as conditional blocks:

   .. image:: pdf_reports/XML-condition-if.png
      :alt: Output preview if there are tags.

   You can switch conditions using the editor to preview their output:

   .. image:: pdf_reports/XML-condition-else.png
      :alt: Output preview if there are no tags.

   If you wish to have multiple options, you can also use `t-elif` directives to add intermediary
   conditions. For example, this is how the title of sales order reports changes based on the
   condition of the underlying document.

   .. code-block:: xml

      <h2 class="mt-4">
          <span t-if="env.context.get('proforma', False) or is_pro_forma">Pro-Forma Invoice # </span>
          <span t-elif="doc.state in ['draft','sent']">Quotation # </span>
          <span t-else="">Order # </span>
          <span t-field="doc.name">SO0000</span>
      </h2>

   The title *Pro-Forma Invoice* is used depending on some contextual conditions. If these
   conditions are not met and the state of the document is either `draft` or `sent`, then
   *Quotation* is used. If none of those conditions are met, the report's title is *Order*.

.. spoiler:: Images

   Working with images in a report can be challenging, as precise control over image size and
   behavior is not always obvious. You can insert image fields using the report editor
   (by using the :ref:`Field command <studio/pdf-reports/add-field>`), but inserting them in XML
   using the `t-field` directive and accompanying `t-options` attributes provides better sizing and
   positioning control.

   For example, the following code outputs the field `image_128` of the line's product as a
   64px-wide image (with an automatic height based on the image's aspect ratio).

   .. code-block:: xml

      <span t-field="line.product_id.image_128" t-options-widget="image" t-options-width="64px"/>

   The following options are available for image widgets:

   - `width`: width of the image, usually in pixels or CSS length units (e.g., `rem`) (leave empty
     for auto-width).
   - `height`: height of the image, usually in pixels or CSS length units (e.g., `rem`) (leave empty
     for auto-height).
   - `class`: CSS classes applied on the `img` tag; `Bootstrap classes
     <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/content/tables>`_ are available.
   - `alt`: alternative text of the image
   - `style`: style attribute; it allows you to override styles more freely than with
     `Bootstrap classes <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/content/tables>`_.

   These attributes must contain strings, i.e., text enclosed within quotes within quotes, e.g.,
   `t-options-width="'64px'"` (or, alternatively, a valid Python expression).

   .. note::
      The image widget cannot be used on an `img` tag. Instead, set the `t-field` directive on a
      `span` (for inline content) or `div` (for block content) node.

   For example, let's add a column with the product image in the quotation table:

   .. code-block:: xml
      :emphasize-lines: 4,14-20

      <table class="table table-sm o_main_table table-borderless mt-4">
          <thead style="display: table-row-group">
              <tr>
                  <th>Image</th>
                  <th name="th_description" class="text-start">Description</th>
                  <th>Product Category</th>
                  <th name="th_quantity" class="text-end">Quantity</th>
                  <th name="th_priceunit" class="text-end">Unit Price</th>
      [...]
              <t t-foreach="lines_to_report" t-as="line">
                  <t t-set="current_subtotal" t-value="current_subtotal + line.price_subtotal"/>
                  <tr t-att-class="'bg-200 fw-bold o_line_section' if line.display_type == 'line_section' else 'fst-italic o_line_note' if line.display_type == 'line_note' else ''">
                      <t t-if="not line.display_type">
                         <td>
                             <span t-field="line.product_template_id.image_128"
                                   t-options-widget="'image'"
                                   t-options-width="'64px'"
                                   t-options-class="'rounded-3 shadow img-thumbnail'"
                                 />
                         </td>
                          <td name="td_name"><span t-field="line.name">Bacon Burger</span></td>
                          <td t-out="line.product_id.categ_id.display_name"/>

   The `t-options-width` attribute restricts the image width to 64 pixels, and the Bootstrap classes
   used in `t-options-class` create a thumbnail-like border with rounded corners and a shadow.
