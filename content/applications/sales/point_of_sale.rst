a web browser, even if you are temporarily offline. Product moves are automatically registered in
your stock, you get real-time statistics, and your data is consolidated across all shops.

Control` screen, click :guilabel:`Open Session` to start a POS session, or click :guilabel:`Continue
Selling` if the session is already opened.

   same time. However, the session can only be opened once on the same browser.

.. tip::
   - You can use both `,` and `.` on your keyboard as decimal separators.
   - **Cash** is selected by default if you enter the amount without choosing a payment method.

.. note::
   The system can only load a limited number of products for effective opening. Click
   :guilabel:`Search more` if the desired product is not loaded automatically.

.. _pos/customers:

Set customers
=============

Registering your customer is necessary to :doc:`collect their loyalty points and grant them rewards
<point_of_sale/pricing/loyalty>`, automatically apply the :doc:`attributed pricelist
<point_of_sale/pricing/pricelists>`, or :ref:`generate and print an invoice
<receipts-invoices/invoices>`.

You can create customers from an :ref:`open POS session <pos/session-start>` by clicking
:menuselection:`Customer --> Create`, and filling in the contact information. You can also create
customers from the backend by going to :menuselection:`Point of Sale --> Orders --> Customers` and
clicking :guilabel:`New`. Then, fill in the information and save.

To set a customer during an order, access the list of customers by clicking :guilabel:`Customer` on
the POS interface. You can also set a customer at the payment screen by clicking
:guilabel:`Customer`.

.. _pos/customer-notes:

Customer notes
==============

You can add **customer notes** about specific products directly from an open :ref:`POS session
<pos/session-start>`. For instance, to provide cleaning and maintenance tips. They can also be used
to track a customer's particular request, such as not wanting the product to be assembled for them.

To do so, select a product and click :guilabel:`Customer Note` on the pad. Doing so opens a pop-up
window in which you can add or modify content for the note.

.. note::
   Product notes from an :doc:`imported SO <point_of_sale/shop/sales_order>` are displayed
   identically in the cart.

Customer notes appear on customers' receipts and invoices similarly to how they appear in the cart,
under the related product.

.. _pos/refund:

Return and refund products
==========================

To return and refund a product,

#. :ref:`start a session <pos/session-start>` from the **POS dashboard**;
#. click :guilabel:`Refund` and select the corresponding order;
#. select the product and the quantity to refund using the keypad;
#. click :guilabel:`Refund` to go back to the previous screen;
#. once the order is completed, click :guilabel:`Payment` to proceed to the refund;
#. click :guilabel:`Validate` and :guilabel:`New Order` to move on to the next customer.

.. note::
   - You can filter the **orders list** by :guilabel:`Receipt Number`, :guilabel:`Date` or
     :guilabel:`Customer` using the search bar.
   - You can also refund a product by selecting the returned product from an open session, and
     setting a negative quantity that equals the number of returned products. To do so, click
     :guilabel:`Qty` and :guilabel:`+/-`, followed by the quantity of returned products.

Once the return payment is validated, Odoo generates the required credit note, referencing the
original receipt or invoice and partially or fully canceling the document.

.. _pos/cash-register:

Manage the cash register
========================

To add or take out cash from the register, click the **menu icon** in the upper right corner of your
screen and :guilabel:`Cash In/Out`.

.. image:: point_of_sale/menu-button.png
   :alt: Dropdown menu to close a POS session, reach the backend, add or take cash out or check
         orders

Doing so opens a pop-up window on which you can select :guilabel:`Cash In` or :guilabel:`Cash Out`,
enter the amount and the reason, and click :guilabel:`Confirm`.

.. _pos/session-close:

Close the POS session
=====================

To close your session, click the **menu icon** in the upper right corner of your screen and
:guilabel:`Close Session`.

Doing so opens the :guilabel:`Closing Control` pop-up screen. From this screen, you can retrieve
various information:

- the number of orders made and the total amount made during the session;
- the expected amounts grouped by payment method.

Before closing this window, count your cash using the calculator icon. Doing so opens a pop-up
window that computes the total amount in the cash drawer depending on the coins and bills counted
and added manually. Then, click :guilabel:`Confirm` or :guilabel:`Discard` to close the window. The
computed amount is set in the :guilabel:`Counted` column, and the :guilabel:`Money Details` are
specified in the **Notes** section.

   :alt: How to close a POS session.

Once you are done controlling the amounts, click :guilabel:`Close Session` to close and go back to
the **POS dashboard**.

.. note::
   - To reach the backend without closing the session, click :guilabel:`Backend` on the dropdown
     menu.
   - To abort, click :guilabel:`Discard` on the pop-up window.
   - Depending on your setup, you might only be allowed to close a session if the expected cash
     revenue equals the counted cash. To close it anyway, click :guilabel:`Ok` on the
     :guilabel:`Payments Difference` screen.

.. tip::
   - It is strongly advised to close your POS session at the end of each day.
   - To look at all your previous sessions, go to :menuselection:`Point of Sale --> Orders -->
     Sessions`.
