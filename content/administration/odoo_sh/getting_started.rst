Main components
---------------

When working with Odoo.sh, it is important to understand the main components involved. While they
are all interconnected, each one plays a distinct role in the development and deployment of Odoo
applications:

- **GitHub repository**: a version-controlled space where the Odoo applications' source code is
  stored. It tracks every change, supports collaboration, and can be either public or private.

- **Odoo.sh project**: a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that integrates with GitHub and enables
  streamlined development, testing, and deployment of Odoo applications. It includes tools such as
  automated backups, staging environments, and continuous integration pipelines.

- **Odoo database**: a database stores all the operational data used and generated by Odoo
  applications, such as business records, configurations, and user data.

Together, they form a cohesive pipeline from code development to a live business use.

User types
----------

Odoo.sh involves different types of users, each with a specific role in the project lifecycle:

- GitHub users: developers with access to the GitHub repository linked to the Odoo.sh project.
  Access to the repository does not automatically make someone a collaborator on the Odoo.sh
  project.

- Odoo.sh collaborators: individuals managing the Odoo.sh project. Each collaborator must be
  linked to a GitHub user. However, collaborators are not the same as database users.

- Database users: end-users of the deployed Odoo database. They interact with the live system but
  are not involved in development or project management.
