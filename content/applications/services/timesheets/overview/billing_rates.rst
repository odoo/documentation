Timesheet billing rates and leaderboard
=======================================

Odooâ€™s **Timesheets** app allows you to set personalized billable time targets for employees. In
addition to billable time targets, a leaderboard can be enabled to motivate employees and gamify
their experience. The leaderboard displays billable and total time logged by employees, and can be
enhanced with motivational quotes.

Billing rate indicators
=======================

To enable billing rate indicators, navigate to :menuselection:`Timesheets --> Configuration --> Settings`,
then enable :guilabel:`Billing Rate Indicators`, and press :guilabel:`Save`.

A new item, :guilabel:`Billing Time Targets` is then added in the :guilabel:`Configuration` menu. To
set up the targets, click :guilabel:`Billing Time Targets`, then encode the :guilabel:`Monthly
Billing Time Target` in hours or days, depending on the **Encoding Method** selected in the
**Timesheets** app configuration.

.. note::
   Once the :guilabel:`billing rate indicators` have been enabled in **Timesheets** app
   configuration, you can also navigate to the **Employees** app, access the employee form that you
   wish to edit, and navigate to the :guilabel:`Settings` tab. Scroll down to
   :guilabel:`Application settings`, then encode the :guilabel:`Monthly Billing Time Target`.
