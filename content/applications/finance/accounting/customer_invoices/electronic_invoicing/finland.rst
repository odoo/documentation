====================================

Legal framework for e-invoicing in Finland
==========================================

In Finland, businesses must comply with e-invoicing regulations to ensure secure, authentic, and
storable transactions. The primary legal framework governing e-invoicing is the `Act on Electronic
Invoicing (241/2019) <https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2019/20190241#Pidp446241968>`_, which
aligns with `EU Directive 2014/55/EU <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014L0055>`_
on electronic invoicing in public procurement. Under Finnish law, all :abbr:`B2G
(business-to-government)` transactions require the use of electronic invoices via Apix Messaging or
other Peppol-connected platforms, Finland’s standard for public sector e-invoicing. Finland is also
part of the Peppol network, ensuring interoperability and standardization for cross-border
e-invoicing within the EU. Additionally, e-invoicing is widely adopted for B2B transactions,
promoting efficient processes and improved tax compliance.

Odoo invoicing module makes it easy for businesses to adhere to Finland's e-invoicing regulations.
Here is how Odoo ensures compliance:

- **Supported formats**: Odoo supports the e-invoicing formats widely used in Finland, including
  TEAPPSXML, Finvoice, and the standardized XML in :abbr:`UBL (Universal Business Language)` format
  required for Peppol compliance. This ensures compatibility with Finnish platforms such as Handi
  for public sector invoicing and eKuitti for enhanced receipt management and e-invoicing.
- **Secure storage and retrieval**: In accordance with Finnish regulations requiring businesses to
  store invoices for a minimum of seven years, Odoo securely archives all invoices in a tamper-proof
  system, allowing for easy retrieval during audits.
- **Automatic VAT calculation and reporting**: Odoo Invoicing ensures compliance with Finnish VAT
  requirements by automatically calculating and including VAT in invoices and formatting them to
  meet the legal standards for both B2B and :abbr:`B2G (business-to-government)` transactions.
