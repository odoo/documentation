be added to the already created and signed worksheet. Then, create a new invoice for the time added.

*Mark as done* to close the task and to invoice your intervention. It also validates the
stock-picking keeping your inventory up-to-date.

*Sign Report* generates a detailed worksheet report for the customer to sign. Send it through email
clicking on *Send Report*.

Invoice your time and material
