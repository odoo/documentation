Validity of electronic signatures
=================================

The legal validity of electronic signatures generated by Odoo depends on your country's legislation.
Documents signed using the Sign app are considered legally valid in the :ref:`European Union
<sign/validity/eu>` and the :ref:`United States of America <sign/validity/united-states>`. They also
meet the requirements for electronic signatures in
:ref:`most countries <sign/validity/other-countries>`.

Companies doing business abroad should also consider other countries' electronic signature laws.

   As laws governing electronic signatures rapidly evolve, we cannot guarantee that all information

   signature compliance and validity.

European Union
--------------

The `eIDAS regulation <http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj>`_ establishes the framework for
electronic signatures in the `27 member states of the European Union
<https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries_en>`_. It distinguishes three types of
electronic signatures:

#. Simple electronic signatures
#. Advanced electronic signatures
#. Qualified electronic signatures

Odoo generates the first type, **simple electronic signatures**; these signatures are legally valid
in the EU, as stated in the eIDAS regulation.

Electronic signatures may not be automatically recognized as valid. You may need to bring
supporting evidence of a signature's validity. While the Sign app provides a simple electronic
signature, some supporting evidence is automatically collected during the signature process, such
as:

#. Email validation and SMS validation (if enabled)
#. Strong identity proof through itsme® (if enabled)
#. Timestamped, IP and geographically traceable access logs to the documents and their associated
   signatures
#. Document traceability and inalterability (any alteration made to a signed document is detected by
   Odoo with the use of cryptographic proofs)

.. _sign/validity/united-states:

United States of America
------------------------

The `ESIGN Act (Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act)
<https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/compliance/manual/10/X-3.1.pdf>`_, at the interstate and
international levels, and the `UETA (Uniform Electronic Transactions Act)
<https://www.uniformlaws.org/committees/community-home/librarydocuments?communitykey=2c04b76c-2b7d-4399-977e-d5876ba7e034&tab=librarydocuments>`_,
at the state level, provide the legal framework for electronic signatures. Note that `Illinois
<https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs5.asp?ActID=89&>`_ and `New York
<https://its.ny.gov/electronic-signatures-and-records-act-esra>`_ have not adopted the UETA, but
similar acts instead.

Overall, to be recognized as valid, electronic signatures have to meet five criteria:

#. The signer must show a clear **intent to sign**. For example, using a mouse to draw a signature
   can show intent. The signer must also have the option to opt out of the electronic document.
#. The signer must first express or imply their **consent to conduct business electronically**.
#. **The signature must be clearly attributed**. In Odoo, metadata, such as the signer's IP address,
   is added to the signature, which can be used as supporting evidence.
#. **The signature must be associated with the signed document**, for example, by keeping a record
   detailing how the signature was captured.
#. Electronically signed documents need to be **retained and stored** by all parties involved; for
   example, by providing the signer either a fully-executed copy or the possibility to download a
   copy.
