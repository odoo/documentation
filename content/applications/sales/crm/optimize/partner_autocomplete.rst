Enrich your contacts with corporate data
========================================

| From any module, once you start to create a new contact typing the name of it, the system
  will suggest a potential match. If you select it, the contact will be populated with corporate
  data.
| For example, after typing *Odoo*, you will get the following information:

   :alt: Creating a new contact in Odoo

.. tip:: Partner Autocomplete also works if you enter a VAT number instead of a company name.

Pricing
=======

| *Partner Autocomplete* is an *In-App Purchase (IAP)* service, which requires prepaid credits to be
  used. Each request will consume one credit.
