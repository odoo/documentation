FEC - Fichier des Écritures Comptables
======================================

An FEC :dfn:`Fichier des Écritures Comptables` audit file contains all the accounting data and entries
recorded in all the accounting journals for a financial year. The entries in the file must be
arranged in chronological order.

Since January 1st, 2014, every French company is required to produce and transmit this file upon
request by the tax authorities for audit purposes.

FEC Import
----------

To make the onboarding of new users easier, Odoo Enterprise's French :ref:`fiscal localization
package <fiscal_localizations/packages>` includes the **FEC Import** feature (module name:
``l10n_fr_fec_import``), which enables the import of existing FEC files from older software.

To enable this feature, go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings -->
Accounting Import`, enable **FEC Import**, and *Save*.

Next, go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> FEC Import`, upload your FEC file, and
click on *Import*.

.. note::

    | Importing FEC files from different year takes no particular action or computation.
    | Should multiple files contain any "Reports à Nouveaux" (RAN) with the starting balance of the
      year, you might need to cancel those entries in the User Interface. Odoo makes those entries
      (RAN) useless.

File formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~

FEC files can only be in CSV format, as the XML format is not supported.

.. note::

    The FEC CSV file has a plain text format representing a data table, with the first line being a
    header and defining the list of fields for each entry, and each following line representing one
    accounting entry, in no predetermined order.

Our module expects the files to meet the following technical specifications:

- **Encoding**: UTF-8, UTF-8-SIG and iso8859_15.
- **Separator**: any of these: `;` or `|` or `,` or `TAB`.
- **Line terminators**: both CR+LF (`\\r\\n`) and LF (`\\n`) character groups are supported.
- **Date format**: `%Y%m%d`

Implementation details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following accounting entities are imported from the FEC files: **Accounts, Journals, Partners**,
and **Moves**.

Our module determines the encoding, the line-terminator character, and the separator that are used
in the file.

A check is then performed to see if every line has the correct number of fields corresponding to the
header.

If the check passes, then the file is read in full, kept in memory, and scanned. Accounting entities
are imported one type at a time, in the following order.

Accounts
********

Every accounting entry is related to an account, which should be determined by the field
`CompteNum`.

Code matching
*************

Should a similar account code already be present in the system, the existing one is used instead of
creating a new one.

Accounts in Odoo generally have a number of digits that are default for the fiscal localization. As
the FEC module is related to the French localization, the default number of relevant digits is 6.

This means that the account codes the trailing zeroes are right-trimmed, and that the comparison
between the account codes in the FEC file and the ones already existing in Odoo is performed only on
the first six digits of the codes.

.. example::
   The account code `65800000` in the file is matched against an existing `658000` account in Odoo,
   and that account is used instead of creating a new one.

Reconcilable flag
*****************

An account is technically flagged as *reconcilable* if the first line in which it appears has the
`EcritureLet` field filled out, as this flag means that the accounting entry is going to be
reconciled with another one.

.. note::

    In case the line somehow has this field not filled out, but the entry still has to be reconciled
    with a payment that hasn't yet been recorded, this isn't a problem anyway; the account is
    flagged as reconcilable as soon as the import of the move lines requires it.

Account type and Templates matching
***********************************

As the **type** of the account is not specified in the FEC format, **new** accounts are created
with the default type *Current Assets* and then, at the end of the import process, they are
matched against the installed Chart of Account templates. Also, the *reconcile* flag is also
computed this way.

The match is done with the left-most digits, starting by using all digits, then 3, then 2.

.. example::

   +------------+------------+-----------------+---------------------+---------------------+
   | Name       | Code       | Full comparison | 3-digits comparison | 2-digits comparison |
   +============+============+=================+=====================+=====================+
   | Template   | `400000`   | `400000`        | `400`               | `40`                |
   +------------+------------+-----------------+---------------------+---------------------+
   | CompteNum  | `40100000` | `40100000`      | `401`               | `40`                |
   +------------+------------+-----------------+---------------------+---------------------+
   | **Result** |            |                 |                     | Match **found**     |
   +------------+------------+-----------------+---------------------+---------------------+

The type of the account is then flagged as *payable* and *reconcilable* as per the account template.

Journals
********

Journals are also checked against those already existing in Odoo to avoid duplicates, also in the
case of multiple FEC files imports.

Should a similar journal code already be present in the system, the existing one is used instead of
creating a new one.

New journals have their name prefixed by the string ``FEC-``.

.. example::
   `ACHATS` -> `FEC-ACHATS`

The journals are *not* archived, the user is entitled to handle them as he wishes.

Journal type determination
**************************

The journal type is also not specified in the format (as per the accounts) and therefore it is
at first created with the default type `general`.

At the end of the import process, the type is determined as per these rules regarding related
moves and accounts:

- | `bank`: Moves in these journals always have a line (debit or credit) impacting a
    liquidity account.
  | `cash` / `bank` can be interchanged, so `bank` is set everywhere when this condition is met.
- | `sale`: Moves in these journals mostly have debit lines on receivable accounts and
    credit lines on tax income accounts.
  | Sale refund journal items are debit/credit inverted.
- | `purchase`: Moves in these journals mostly have credit lines on payable accounts and
    debit lines on expense accounts.
  | Purchase refund journal items are debit/credit inverted.
- | `general`: for everything else.

.. note::

    - A minimum of three moves is necessary for journal type identification.
    - A threshold of 70% of moves must correspond to a criteria for a journal type to be determined.

.. example::
   Suppose we are analyzing the moves that share a certain `journal_id`.

   +------------------------------------------------------------+-------+------------+
   | Moves                                                      | Count | Percentage |
   +============================================================+=======+============+
   | that have a sale account line and no purchase account line | 0     | 0          |
   +------------------------------------------------------------+-------+------------+
   | that have a purchase account line and no sale account line | 1     | 25%        |
   +------------------------------------------------------------+-------+------------+
   | that have a liquidity account line                         | 3     | **75%**    |
   +------------------------------------------------------------+-------+------------+
   | **Total**                                                  | 4     | 100%       |
   +------------------------------------------------------------+-------+------------+

   The journal `type` would be `bank`, because the bank moves percentage (75%) exceeds the threshold
   (70%).

Partners
********

Each partner keeps its `Reference` from the field `CompAuxNum`.

.. note::

    These fields are searchable, in line with former FEC imports on the accounting expert's side for
    fiscal/audit purposes.

.. tip::

    Users can merge partners with the Data Cleaning App, where Vendors and Customers or similar
    partner entries may be merged by the user, with assistance from the system that groups them by
    similar entries.

Moves
*****

Entries are immediately posted and reconciled after submission, using the `EcritureLet` field to
do the matching between the entries themselves.

The `EcritureNum` field represents the name of the moves. We noticed that sometimes it may not be
filled out. In this case, the field `PieceRef` is used.

Rounding issues
***************

There is a rounding tolerance with a currency-related precision on debit and credit (i.e., 0.01 for
EUR). Under this tolerance, a new line is added to the move, named *Import rounding difference*,
targeting the accounts:

- `658000` Charges diverses de gestion courante, for added debits
- `758000` Produits divers de gestion courante, for added credits

Missing move name
*****************

Should the `EcritureNum` not be filled out, it may also happen that the `PieceRef` field is also
not suited to determine the move name (it may be used as an accounting move line reference) leaving
no way to actually find which lines are to be grouped in a single move, and effectively impeding the
creation of balanced moves.

One last attempt is made, grouping all lines from the same journal and date (`JournalLib`,
`EcritureDate`). Should this grouping generate balanced moves (sum(credit) - sum(debit) = 0), then
each different combination of journal and date creates a new move.

.. example::
   `ACH` + `2021/05/01` --> new move on journal `ACH` with name `20210501`.

Should this attempt fail, the user is prompted an error message with all the move lines that are
supposedly unbalanced.

Partner information
*******************

If a line has the partner information specified, the information is copied to the accounting move
itself if the targeted Journal is of type *payable* or *receivable*.

Export
------

If you have installed the French :ref:`fiscal localization package <fiscal_localizations/packages>`,
you should be able to download the FEC. To do so, go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Reporting -->
France --> FEC`.

.. tip::

    If you do not see the submenu **FEC**, go to :menuselection:`Apps`, remove the *Apps* filter,
    then search for the module named **France-FEC** and make sure it is installed.

French Accounting Reports
=========================

If you have installed the French Accounting, you will have access to some accounting reports
specific to France:

- Bilan comptable
- Compte de résultats
- Plan de Taxes France

Get the VAT anti-fraud certification with Odoo
==============================================

As of January 1st 2018, a new anti-fraud legislation comes into effect
in France and DOM-TOM. This new legislation stipulates certain criteria
concerning the inalterability, security, storage and archiving of sales data.
These legal requirements are implemented in Odoo, version 9 onward,
through a module and a certificate of conformity to download.

Is my company required to use anti-fraud software?
--------------------------------------------------

Your company is required to use an anti-fraud cash register software like
Odoo (CGI art. 286, I. 3° bis) if:

- You are taxable (not VAT exempt) in France or any DOM-TOM,
- Some of your customers are private individuals (B2C).

This rule applies to any company size. Auto-entrepreneurs are exempted from
VAT and therefore are not affected.

Get certified with Odoo
-----------------------

Getting compliant with Odoo is very easy.

Your company is requested by the tax administration to deliver a certificate
of conformity testifying that your software complies with the anti-fraud
legislation. This certificate is granted by Odoo SA to Odoo Enterprise users
`here <https://www.odoo.com/my/contract/french-certification/>`_.
If you use Odoo Community, you should :doc:`upgrade to Odoo Enterprise
</administration/on_premise/community_to_enterprise>` or contact your Odoo service provider.

In case of non-conformity, your company risks a fine of €7,500.

To get the certification, just follow the following steps:

- If you use **Odoo Point of Sale**, :ref:`install <general/install>` the **France - VAT Anti-Fraud
  Certification for Point of Sale (CGI 286 I-3 bis)** module by going to :menuselection:`Apps`,
  removing the *Apps* filter, then searching for *l10n_fr_pos_cert*, and installing the module.

- Make sure a country is set on your company, otherwise your entries won’t be
  encrypted for the inalterability check. To edit your company’s data,
  go to :menuselection:`Settings --> Users & Companies --> Companies`.
  Select a country from the list; Do not create a new country.
- Download the mandatory certificate of conformity delivered by Odoo SA `here <https://www.odoo.com/my/contract/french-certification/>`__.

.. note::

    - To install the module in any system created before
      December 18th 2017, you should update the modules list.
      To do so, activate the :ref:`developer mode <developer-mode>`.
      Then go to the *Apps* menu and press *Update Modules List* in the top-menu.
    - In case you run Odoo on-premise, you need to update your installation
      and restart your server beforehand.
    - If you have installed the initial version of the anti-fraud module
      (prior to December 18th 2017), you need to update it.
      The module's name was *France - Accounting - Certified CGI 286 I-3 bis*.
      After an update of the modules list, search for
      the updated module in *Apps*, select it and click *Upgrade*.
      Finally, make sure the following module *l10n_fr_sale_closing*
      is installed.

Anti-fraud features
-------------------

The anti-fraud module introduces the following features:

- **Inalterability**: deactivation of all the ways to cancel or modify
  key data of POS orders, invoices and journal entries;
- **Security**: chaining algorithm to verify the inalterability;
- **Storage**: automatic sales closings with computation of both period
  and cumulative totals (daily, monthly, annually).

Inalterability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All the possible ways to cancel and modify key data of paid POS orders,
confirmed invoices and journal entries are deactivated,
if the company is located in France or in any DOM-TOM.

.. note::

    If you run a multi-companies environment, only the documents of such companies are impacted.

Security
~~~~~~~~

To ensure inalterability, every order or journal entry is encrypted
upon validation.
This number (or hash) is calculated from the key data of the document as
well as from the hash of the precedent documents.

The module introduces an interface to test the data inalterability.
If any information is modified on a document after its validation,
the test will fail. The algorithm recomputes all the hashes and compares them
against the initial ones. In case of failure, the system points out the first
corrupted document recorded in the system.

Users with *Manager* access rights can launch the inalterability check.
For POS orders, go to
:menuselection:`Point of Sales --> Reporting --> French Statements`.
For invoices or journal entries,
go to :menuselection:`Invoicing/Accounting --> Reporting --> French Statements`.

Storage
~~~~~~~

The system also processes automatic sales closings on a daily, monthly
and annual basis.
Such closings distinctly compute the sales total of the period as well as
the cumulative grand totals from the very first sales entry recorded
in the system.

Closings can be found in the *French Statements* menu of Point of Sale,
Invoicing and Accounting apps.

.. note::

    - Closings compute the totals for journal entries of sales journals (Journal Type = Sales).

    - For multi-companies environments, such closings are performed by company.

    - POS orders are posted as journal entries at the closing of the POS session.
      Closing a POS session can be done anytime.
      To prompt users to do it on a daily basis, the module prevents from resuming
      a session opened more than 24 hours ago.
      Such a session must be closed before selling again.

    - A period’s total is computed from all the journal entries posted after the
      previous closing of the same type, regardless of their posting date.
      If you record a new sales transaction for a period already closed,
      it will be counted in the very next closing.

.. tip::

    - For test & audit purposes such closings can be manually generated in the
      :ref:`developer mode <developer-mode>`.
    - Then go to :menuselection:`Settings --> Technical --> Automation --> Scheduled Actions`.

Responsibilities
----------------

Do not uninstall the module! If you do so, the hashes will be reset and none
of your past data will be longer guaranteed as being inalterable.

Users remain responsible for their Odoo instance and must use it with
due diligence. It is not permitted to modify the source code which guarantees
the inalterability of data.

Odoo absolves itself of all and any responsibility in case of changes
in the module’s functions caused by 3rd party applications not certified by Odoo.
