Legal framework for e-invoicing in Uruguay
==========================================

Uruguay has mandated electronic invoicing under the :abbr:`CFE (Comprobante Fiscal Electrónico)`
system, which applies to most businesses to promote tax transparency and streamline financial
transactions. Key elements include:

- **Comprobante Fiscal Electrónico**: A mandatory e-invoice format required for B2B, B2C, and
  :abbr:`B2G (business-to-government)` transactions, fully compliant with :abbr:`DGI (Dirección
  General Impositiva)`'s technical standards.
- **Integration with DGI**: All :abbr:`CFE (Comprobante Fiscal Electrónico)` must be submitted to
  the :abbr:`DGI (Dirección General Impositiva)` for validation. Upon approval, the :abbr:`CFE
  (Comprobante Fiscal Electrónico)` receives a unique identification code and authorization for
  issuance.
- **XML Format**: Uruguay mandates the use of XML as the standard format for e-invoices, ensuring
  compatibility and interoperability with various systems.
- **Adoption Timeline**: E-invoicing is mandatory for most businesses, with specific deadlines for
  smaller enterprises to transition into the system.
