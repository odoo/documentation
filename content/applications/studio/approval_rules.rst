Approval rules
==============

Approval rules are used to automate approval processes for actions. They allow you to define
the criteria for when an approval is required before an action can be performed using a button.

Configuration
=============

To add approval rules with Studio, proceed as follows:

#. :ref:`Open Studio <studio/access>` and switch to the required :doc:`view <views>`.
#. Select the button for which you want to add approval rules.
#. In the :guilabel:`Properties` tab on the left, enable the :guilabel:`Set approval rules`
   feature.
#. Specify the :guilabel:`Allowed Group` to limit the approval permission to a specific user
   group.
#. Select the :guilabel:`Responsible` user to create an activity for a specific user when approval
   is requested from them.
#. Select the :guilabel:`Users to notify` via internal note.
#. Add a :guilabel:`Description` to be displayed in the :ref:`Approval dialog <approval-rules/use>`.

Optionally, you can also add conditions for the approval rule to be applied by clicking the
:icon:`fa-filter` (:guilabel:`filter`) icon next to the :guilabel:`Allowed Group` field.

To add another rule, click :guilabel:`Add an approval rule`. When there are multiple approval rules,
you can:

- enable :guilabel:`Exclusive Approval` to require approvers to be different users;
- change the :guilabel:`Notification Order` of the approval rule so that the :guilabel:`Responsible`
  and :guilabel:`Users to notify` are only notified when the previous rule has been approved, and
  their approval is required. If the approval rules have the same :guilabel:`Notification Order`,
  all users are notified at the same time when the first approval is requested.

Click the :icon:`fa-trash` (:guilabel:`trash`) icon next to the :guilabel:`Allowed Group` field to
delete the approval rule.

.. tip::
   You can create :ref:`user groups <access-rights/groups>` specifically for approvals.

Once approval rules have been defined for a button:

- A **user avatar** icon is displayed next to the button's label for each approval rule that has
  been defined.

- When an unauthorized user clicks the button, an error message is displayed in the top-right corner
  and an activity is created for the user specified in the :guilabel:`Responsible` field.
- Only users from the group defined in the :guilabel:`Allowed Group` field are authorized to approve
  or reject the action.

Authorized users can:

- approve and perform the action by clicking the button;
- approve the action and allow another user to perform it by clicking the **user avatar** icon next
  to the button's label, then clicking the :icon:`fa-check` (:guilabel:`Approve`) button in the
  dialog that opens;
- reject the action by clicking the **user avatar** icon next to the button's label, then clicking
  the :icon:`fa-times` (:guilabel:`Reject`) button in the dialog that opens.

.. tip::
   - The user who approved/rejected the action can revoke their decision by clicking the **user
     avatar** icon next to the button's label, then clicking the :icon:`fa-undo`
     (:guilabel:`Revoke`) button.
   - Approvals are tracked in the record's chatter. An approval entry is also created every time
     a Studio approval-related action is performed. To access the approval entries, :doc:`activate
     the developer mode </applications/general/developer_mode>` and go to :menuselection:`Settings
     --> Technical --> Studio Approval Entries`.
