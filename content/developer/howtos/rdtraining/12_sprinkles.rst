Chapter 12: Add The Sprinkles
=============================

Our real estate module now makes sense from a business perspective. We created
:ref:`specific views <howto/rdtraining/07_basicviews>`, added several
:ref:`action buttons <howto/rdtraining/10_actions>` and
:ref:`constraints <howto/rdtraining/11_constraints>`. However our user interface is still a bit
rough. We would like to add some colors to the list views and make some fields and buttons conditionally
disappear. For example, the 'Sold' and 'Cancel' buttons should disappear when the property
is sold or canceled since it is no longer allowed to change the state at this point.

This chapter covers a very small subset of what can be done in the views. Do not hesitate to
read the reference documentation for a more complete overview.

**Reference**: the documentation related to this chapter can be found in
:ref:`reference/views`.

Inline Views
============

.. note::

    **Goal**: at the end of this section, a specific list of properties should be added to the property
    type view:

    .. image:: 12_sprinkles/media/inline_view.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Inline list view

In the real estate module we added a list of offers for a property. We simply added the field
``offer_ids`` with:

.. code-block:: xml

    <field name="offer_ids"/>

The field uses the specific view for ``estate.property.offer``. In some cases we want to define
a specific list view which is only used in the context of a form view. For example, we would like
to display the list of properties linked to a property type. However, we only want to display 3
fields for clarity: name, expected price and state.

To do this, we can define *inline* list views. An inline list view is defined directly inside
a form view. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    from odoo import fields, models

    class TestModel(models.Model):
        _name = "test.model"
        _description = "Test Model"

        description = fields.Char()
        line_ids = fields.One2many("test.model.line", "model_id")


    class TestModelLine(models.Model):
        _name = "test.model.line"
        _description = "Test Model Line"

        model_id = fields.Many2one("test.model")
        field_1 = fields.Char()
        field_2 = fields.Char()
        field_3 = fields.Char()

.. code-block:: xml

    <form>
        <field name="description"/>
        <field name="line_ids">
            <tree>
                <field name="field_1"/>
                <field name="field_2"/>
            </tree>
        </field>
    </form>

In the form view of the ``test.model``, we define a specific list view for ``test.model.line``
with fields ``field_1`` and ``field_2``.

An example can be found
`here <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/0e12fa135882cd5095dbf15fe2f64231c6a84336/addons/event/views/event_tag_views.xml#L27-L33>`__.

.. exercise:: Add an inline list view.

    - Add the ``One2many`` field ``property_ids`` to the ``estate.property.type`` model.
    - Add the field in the ``estate.property.type`` form view as depicted in the **Goal** of this
      section.

Widgets
=======

**Reference**: the documentation related to this section can be found in
:ref:`reference/js/widgets`.

.. note::

    **Goal**: at the end of this section, the state of the property should be displayed using a
    specific widget:

    .. image:: 12_sprinkles/media/widget.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Statusbar widget

    Four states are displayed: New, Offer Received, Offer Accepted and Sold.

Whenever we've added fields to our models, we've (almost) never had to worry about how
these fields would look like in the user interface. For example, a date picker is provided
for a ``Date`` field and a ``One2many`` field is automatically displayed as a list. Odoo
chooses the right 'widget' depending on the field type.

However, in some cases, we want a specific representation of a field which can be done thanks to
the ``widget`` attribute. We already used it for the ``tag_ids`` field when we used the
``widget="many2many_tags"`` attribute. If we hadn't used it, then the field would have displayed as a
list.

Each field type has a set of widgets which can be used to fine tune its display. Some widgets also
take extra options. An exhaustive list can be found in :ref:`reference/js/widgets`.

.. exercise:: Use the status bar widget.

    Use the ``statusbar`` widget in order to display the ``state`` of the ``estate.property`` as
    depicted in the **Goal** of this section.

    Tip: a simple example can be found
    `here <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/0e12fa135882cd5095dbf15fe2f64231c6a84336/addons/account/views/account_bank_statement_views.xml#L136>`__.

.. warning:: Same field multiple times in a view

    Add a field only **once** to a list or a form view. Adding it multiple times is
    not supported.

List Order
==========

**Reference**: the documentation related to this section can be found in
:ref:`reference/orm/models`.

.. note::

    **Goal**: at the end of this section, all lists should display by default in a deterministic
    order. Property types can be ordered manually.

During the previous exercises, we created several list views. However, at no point did we specify
which order the records had to be listed in by default. This is a very important thing for many business
cases. For example, in our real estate module we would want to display the highest offers on top of the
list.

Model
-----

Odoo provides several ways to set a default order. The most common way is to define
the ``_order`` attribute directly in the model. This way, the retrieved records will follow
a deterministic order which will be consistent in all views including when records are searched
programmatically. By default there is no order specified, therefore the records will be
retrieved in a non-deterministic order depending on PostgreSQL.

The ``_order`` attribute takes a string containing a list of fields which will be used for sorting.
It will be converted to an order_by_ clause in SQL. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    from odoo import fields, models

    class TestModel(models.Model):
        _name = "test.model"
        _description = "Test Model"
        _order = "id desc"

        description = fields.Char()

Our records are ordered by descending ``id``, meaning the highest comes first.

.. exercise:: Add model ordering.

    Define the following orders in their corresponding models:

    =================================== ===================================
    Model                               Order
    =================================== ===================================
    ``estate.property``                 Descending ID
    ``estate.property.offer``           Descending Price
    ``estate.property.tag``             Name
    ``estate.property.type``            Name
    =================================== ===================================

View
----

Ordering is possible at the model level. This has the advantage of a consistent order everywhere
a list of records is retrieved. However, it is also possible to define a specific order directly
in a view thanks to the ``default_order`` attribute
(`example <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/892dd6860733c46caf379fd36f57219082331b66/addons/crm/report/crm_activity_report_views.xml#L30>`__).

Manual
------

Both model and view ordering allow flexibility when sorting records, but there is still one case
we need to cover: the manual ordering. A user may want to sort records depending on the business
logic. For example, in our real estate module we would like to sort the property types manually.
It is indeed useful to have the most used types appear at the top of the list. If our real estate
agency mainly sells houses, it is more convenient to have 'House' appear before 'Apartment'.

To do so, a ``sequence`` field is used in combination with the ``handle`` widget. Obviously
the ``sequence`` field must be the first field in the ``_order`` attribute.

.. exercise:: Add manual ordering.

    - Add the following field:

    =================================== ======================= =======================
    Model                               Field                   Type
    =================================== ======================= =======================
    ``estate.property.type``            Sequence                Integer
    =================================== ======================= =======================

    - Add the sequence to the ``estate.property.type`` list view with the correct widget.

    Tip: you can find an example here:
    `model <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/892dd6860733c46caf379fd36f57219082331b66/addons/crm/models/crm_stage.py#L36>`__
    and
    `view <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/892dd6860733c46caf379fd36f57219082331b66/addons/crm/views/crm_stage_views.xml#L23>`__.

Attributes and options
======================

It would be prohibitive to detail all the available features which allow fine tuning of the look of a
view. Therefore, we'll stick to the most common ones.

Form
----

.. note::

    **Goal**: at the end of this section, the property form view will have:

    - Conditional display of buttons and fields
    - Tag colors

    .. image:: 12_sprinkles/media/form.gif
      :align: center
      :alt: Form view with sprinkles


In our real estate module, we want to modify the behavior of some fields. For example, we don't
want to be able to create or edit a property type from the form view. Instead we expect the
types to be handled in their appropriate menu. We also want to give tags a color. In order to add these
behavior customizations, we can add the ``options`` attribute to several field widgets.

.. exercise:: Add widget options.

    - Add the appropriate option to the ``property_type_id`` field to prevent the creation and the
      editing of a property type from the property form view. Have a look at the
      :ref:`Many2one widget documentation <reference/js/widgets>` for more info.

    - Add the following field:

    =================================== ======================= =======================
    Model                               Field                   Type
    =================================== ======================= =======================
    ``estate.property.tag``             Color                   Integer
    =================================== ======================= =======================

    Then add the appropriate option to the ``tag_ids`` field to add a color picker on the tags.
    Have a look at the :ref:`FieldMany2ManyTags widget documentation <reference/js/widgets>`
    for more info.

In :ref:`howto/rdtraining/06_firstui`, we saw that reserved fields were used for
specific behaviors. For example, the ``active`` field is used to automatically filter out
inactive records. We added the ``state`` as a reserved field as well. It's now time to use it!
A ``state`` field is used in combination with a ``states`` attribute in the view to display
buttons conditionally.

.. exercise:: Add conditional display of buttons.

    Use the ``states`` attribute to display the header buttons conditionally as depicted
    in this section's **Goal** (notice how the 'Sold' and 'Cancel' buttons change when the state is modified).

    Tip: do not hesitate to search for ``states=`` in the Odoo XML files for some examples.

More generally, it is possible to make a field ``invisible``, ``readonly`` or ``required`` based
on the value of other fields thanks to the ``attrs`` attribute. Note that ``invisible`` can also be applied
to other elements of the view such as ``button`` or ``group``.

The ``attrs`` is a dictionary with the property as a key and a domain as a value. The domain gives
the conditon in which the property applies. For example:

.. code-block:: xml

    <form>
        <field name="description" attrs="{'invisible': [('is_partner', '=', False)]}"/>
        <field name="is_partner" invisible="1"/>
    </form>

This means that the ``description`` field is invisible when ``is_partner`` is ``False``. It is
important to note that a field used in an ``attrs`` **must** be present in the view. If it
should not be displayed to the user, we can use the ``invisible`` attribute to hide it.

.. exercise:: Use ``attrs``.

    - Make the garden area and orientation invisible in the ``estate.property`` form view when
      there is no garden.
    - Make the 'Accept' and 'Refuse' buttons invisible once the offer state is set.
    - Do not allow adding an offer when the property state is 'Offer Accepted', 'Sold' or
      'Canceled'. To do this use the ``readonly`` ``attrs``.

.. warning::

    Using a (conditional) ``readonly`` attribute in the view can be useful to prevent data entry
    errors, but keep in mind that it doesn't provide any level of security! There is no check done
    server-side, therefore it's always possible to write on the field through a RPC call.

List
----

.. note::

    **Goal**: at the end of this section, the property and offer list views should have color decorations.
    Additionally, offers and tags will be editable directly in the list, and the availability date will be
    hidden by default.

    .. image:: 12_sprinkles/media/decoration.png
      :align: center
      :alt: List view with decorations and optional field

    .. image:: 12_sprinkles/media/editable_list.gif
      :align: center
      :alt: Editable list

When the model only has a few fields, it can be useful to edit records directly through the list
view and not have to open the form view. In the real estate example, there is no need to open a form view
to add an offer or create a new tag. This can be achieved thanks to the ``editable`` attribute.

.. exercise:: Make list views editable.

    Make the ``estate.property.offer`` and ``estate.property.tag`` list views editable.

On the other hand, when a model has a lot of fields it can be tempting to add too many fields in the
list view and make it unclear. An alternative method is to add the fields, but make them optionally
hidden. This can be achieved thanks to the ``optional`` attribute.

.. exercise:: Make a field optional.

    Make the field ``date_availability`` on the ``estate.property`` list view optional and hidden by
    default.

Finally, color codes are useful to visually emphasize records. For example, in the real estate
module we would like to display refused offers in red and accepted offers in green. This can be achieved
thanks to the ``decoration-{$name}`` attribute (see :ref:`reference/js/widgets` for a
complete list):

.. code-block:: xml

    <tree decoration-success="is_partner==True">
        <field name="name">
        <field name="is_partner" invisible="1">
    </tree>

The records where ``is_partner`` is ``True`` will be displayed in green.

.. exercise:: Add some decorations.

    On the ``estate.property`` list view:

    - Properties with an offer received are green
    - Properties with an offer accepted are green and bold
    - Properties sold are muted

    On the ``estate.property.offer`` list view:

    - Refused offers are red
    - Accepted offers are green
    - The state should not be visible anymore

    Tips:

    - Keep in mind that **all** fields used in attributes must be in the view!
    - If you want to test the color of the "Offer Received" and "Offer Accepted" states, add the
      field in the form view and change it manually (we'll implement the business logic for this later).

Search
------

**Reference**: the documentation related to this section can be found in
:ref:`reference/views/search` and :ref:`reference/views/search/defaults`.

.. note::

    **Goal**: at the end of this section, the available properties will be filtered by default,
    and searching on the living area returns results where the area is larger than the given
    number.

    .. image:: 12_sprinkles/media/search.gif
      :align: center
      :alt: Default filters and domains

Last but not least, there are some tweaks we would like to apply when searching. First of all, we
want to have our 'Available' filter applied by default when we access the properties. To make this happen, we
need to use the ``search_default_{$name}`` action context, where ``{$name}`` is the filter name.
This means that we can define which filter(s) will be activated by default at the action level.

Here is an example of an
`action <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/6decc32a889b46947db6dd4d42ef995935894a2a/addons/crm/report/crm_opportunity_report_views.xml#L115>`__
with its
`corresponding filter <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/6decc32a889b46947db6dd4d42ef995935894a2a/addons/crm/report/crm_opportunity_report_views.xml#L68>`__.

.. exercise:: Add a default filter.

    Make the 'Available' filter selected by default in the ``estate.property`` action.

Another useful improvement in our module would be the ability to search efficiently by living area.
In practice, a user will want to search for properties of 'at least' the given area. It is unrealistic
to expect users would want to find a property of an exact living area. It is always
possible to make a custom search, but that's inconvenient.

Search view ``<field>`` elements can have a ``filter_domain`` that overrides
the domain generated for searching on the given field. In the given domain,
``self`` represents the value entered by the user. In the example below, it is
used to search on both ``name`` and ``description`` fields.

.. code-block:: xml

    <search string="Test">
        <field name="description" string="Name and description"
               filter_domain="['|', ('name', 'ilike', self), ('description', 'ilike', self)]"/>
        </group>
    </search>

.. exercise:: Change the living area search.

    Add a ``filter_domain`` to the living area to include properties with an area equal to or
    greater than the given value.

Stat Buttons
============

.. note::

    **Goal**: at the end of this section, there will be a stat button on the property type form view
    which shows the list of all offers related to properties of the given type when it is clicked on.

    .. image:: 12_sprinkles/media/stat_button.gif
      :align: center
      :alt: Stat button

If you've already used some functional modules in Odoo, you've probably already encountered a 'stat
button'. These buttons are displayed on the top right of a form view and give a quick access to
linked documents. In our real estate module, we would like to have a quick link to the offers
related to a given property type as depicted in the **Goal** of this section.

At this point of the tutorial we have already seen most of the concepts to do this. However,
there is not a single solution and it can still be confusing if you don't know where to start from.
We'll describe a step-by-step solution in the exercise. It can always be useful to find some
examples in the Odoo codebase by looking for ``oe_stat_button``.

The following exercise might be a bit more difficult than the previous ones since it assumes you
are able to search for examples in the source code on your own. If you are stuck there is probably
someone nearby who can help you ;-)

The exercise introduces the concept of :ref:`reference/fields/related`. The easiest way to
understand it is to consider it as a specific case of a computed field. The following definition
of the ``description`` field:

.. code-block:: python

        ...

        partner_id = fields.Many2one("res.partner", string="Partner")
        description = fields.Char(related="partner_id.name")

is equivalent to:

.. code-block:: python

        ...

        partner_id = fields.Many2one("res.partner", string="Partner")
        description = fields.Char(compute="_compute_description")

        @api.depends("partner_id.name")
        def _compute_description(self):
            for record in self:
                record.description = record.partner_id.name

Every time the partner name is changed, the description is modified.

.. exercise:: Add a stat button to property type.

    - Add the field ``property_type_id`` to ``estate.property.offer``. We can define it as a
      related field on ``property_id.property_type_id`` and set it as stored.

    Thanks to this field, an offer will be linked to a property type when it's created. You can add
    the field to the list view of offers to make sure it works.

    - Add the field ``offer_ids`` to ``estate.property.type`` which is the One2many inverse of
      the field defined in the previous step.

    - Add the field ``offer_count`` to ``estate.property.type``. It is a computed field that counts
      the number of offers for a given property type (use ``offer_ids`` to do so).

    At this point, you have all the information necessary to know how many offers are linked to
    a property type. When in doubt, add ``offer_ids`` and ``offer_count`` directly to the view.
    The next step is to display the list when clicking on the stat button.

    - Create a stat button on ``estate.property.type`` pointing to the ``estate.property.offer``
      action. This means you should use the ``type="action"`` attribute (go back to the end of
      :ref:`howto/rdtraining/10_actions` if you need a refresher).

    At this point, clicking on the stat button should display all offers. We still need to filter out the
    offers.

    - On the ``estate.property.offer`` action, add a domain that defines ``property_type_id``
      as equal to the ``active_id`` (= the current record,
      `here is an example <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/df37ce50e847e3489eb43d1ef6fc1bac6d6af333/addons/event/views/event_views.xml#L162>`__)

Looking good? If not, don't worry, the :ref:`next chapter <howto/rdtraining/13_inheritance>` doesn't
require stat buttons ;-)
