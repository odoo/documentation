Edition (the "Software"), hosted on Odoo SA's Cloud platforms (the "Cloud Platform") or
on-premises ("Self-Hosting"), you (the "Customer") are agreeing to be bound by the
following terms and conditions (the "Agreement").

.. _term:

1 Term of the Agreement
=======================

The duration of this Agreement (the “Term”) shall be specified in writing on conclusion of this
Agreement, beginning on the date of conclusion.
It is automatically renewed for an equal Term, unless either party provides a written notice of
termination minimum 30 days before the end of the Term to the other party.

.. _definitions:

2 Definitions
=============

User
    Any user account indicated as active in the Software, with access to creation and/or edition mode.
    Deactivated user accounts and accounts used by external people (or systems) who only have
    limited access to the Software through the portal facilities (known as "portal Users") are not
    counted as Users.

App
    An "App" is a specialized group of features available for installation in the Software,
    and listed in the public Pricing section of `Odoo SA's website <https://www.odoo.com>`_.

Odoo Partner
    An Odoo Partner is a third-party company or individual, chosen by the Customer, and working
    with the Customer for their Odoo related services. The Customer can decide at any time to work
    with a different Odoo Partner, or to work with Odoo SA directly (subject to prior notice).

Extra Module
    An extra module is a directory of source code files, or a set of Python-based customizations
    created in a database (e.g. with Odoo Studio), that adds features or changes the standard
    behavior of the Software. It may have been developed by the Customer, by Odoo SA, by an Odoo
    Partner on behalf of the Customer, or by third parties.

Covered Extra Module
    A Covered Extra Module is an Extra Module for which the Customer chooses to pay a maintenance
    fee in order to get support, upgrade and bug fixing services.

Bug
    Is considered a Bug any failure of the Software or of a Covered Extra Module that results in
    a complete stop, error traceback or security breach, and is not directly caused by a defective
    installation or configuration.
    Non-compliance with specifications or requirements will be considered as Bugs at
    the discretion of Odoo SA (typically, when the Software does not produce the results or
    performance it was designed to produce, or when a country-specific feature does not meet legal
    accounting requirements anymore).

Covered Versions
    Unless specified otherwise, the Services provided under this Agreement are applicable only
    to the Covered Versions of the Software, which include the 3 most recently released major
    versions.


.. _enterprise_access:

3 Access to the Software
========================

The Customer can use the Software hosted on the Cloud Platform, or choose the Self-Hosting option.
The Cloud Platform is hosted and fully managed by Odoo SA, and accessed remotely by the Customer.
With the Self-Hosting option, the Customer instead hosts the Software on computer systems of their
choice, that are not under the control of Odoo SA.

For the duration of this Agreement, Odoo SA gives the Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable
license to use (execute, modify, execute after modification) the Odoo Enterprise Edition software,
under the terms set forth in :ref:`appendix_a`.

The Customer agrees to take all necessary measures to guarantee the unmodified execution of
the part of the Software that verifies the validity of the Odoo Enterprise Edition usage and
collects statistics for that purpose, including but not limited to the running of an instance,
the number of Users, the installed Apps, and the number of lines of code of Covered Extra Modules.

Odoo SA commits not to disclose individual or named figures to third parties without the consent
of the Customer, and to deal with all collected data in compliance with its official Privacy
Policy, published at https://www.odoo.com/privacy.

Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, this license is revoked immediately and the
Customer agrees to stop using the Odoo Enterprise Edition software and the Cloud Platform.

Should the Customer breach the terms of this section, the Customer agrees to pay Odoo SA an extra
fee equal to 300% of the applicable list price for the actual number of Users and installed Apps.


.. _services:

4 Services
==========

.. _bugfix:

4.1 Bug Fixing Service
----------------------

For the duration of this Agreement, Odoo SA commits to making all reasonable efforts to remedy any
Bug of the Software and Covered Extra Modules submitted by the Customer through the appropriate
channel (typically, the web form or phone numbers listed on `odoo.com/help <https://www.odoo.com/help>`_,
or when working with an Odoo Partner, the channel provided by the partner), and to start handling
such Customer submissions within 2 business days.

As soon as the Bug is fixed an appropriate remedy will be communicated to the Customer.
If the Customer is using a Covered Version, they will not be asked to upgrade to a more recent
Covered Version of the Software as a remedy to a Bug.

When a Bug is fixed in any Covered Version, Odoo SA commits to fixing the Bug in all more recent
Covered Versions of the Software.

Both parties acknowledge that as specified in the license of the Software and in the :ref:`liability`
section of this Agreement, Odoo SA cannot be held liable for Bugs in the Software
or in Covered Extra Modules.


4.2 Security Updates Service
----------------------------

.. _secu_self_hosting:

Self-Hosting
++++++++++++

For the duration of this Agreement, Odoo SA commits to sending a "Security Advisory" to the Customer
for any security Bug that is discovered in the Covered Versions of the Software (this excludes Extra
Modules), at least 2 weeks before making the Security Advisory public, unless the Bug has already
been disclosed publicly by a third party.
Security Advisories include a complete description of the Bug, its cause, its possible impacts
on the Customer's systems, and the corresponding remedy for each Covered Version.

The Customer understands that the Bug and the information in the Security Advisory must be treated
as Confidential Information as described in :ref:`confidentiality` during the embargo period prior to
the public disclosure.

.. _secu_cloud_platform:

Cloud Platform
++++++++++++++

Odoo SA commits to apply the security remedies for any security Bug discovered in a version of
the Software hosted on the Cloud Platform, on all systems under its control, as soon as
the remedy is available, without requiring any manual action of the Customer.


.. _upgrade:

4.3 Upgrade Services
--------------------

.. _upgrade_odoo:

Upgrade Service for the Software
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For the duration of this Agreement, the Customer can submit upgrade requests through the appropriate
channel (typically Odoo SA's upgrade service website), in order to convert a database of the Software
from any version of the Software to a more recent Covered Version (the "Target Version").

For the Cloud Platform, upgrade requests are submitted directly from the control panel of the
Cloud Platform, and do not require any data upload. For Self-Hosting,
upgrade requests must include a copy of the Customer's database and the
associated data (typically obtained from the Backup menu of the Software).

This service provided through an automated platform in order to allow the Customer to perform
unattended upgrades once a previous version of the Customer's database has been successfully
upgraded for a Covered Version.

The Upgrade Service is limited to the technical conversion and adaptation of the Customer's database
to make it compatible with the Target Version, the correction of any Bug directly caused by the
upgrade operation and not normally occurring in the Target Version, and the conversion of the source
code and data of Covered Extra Modules for the Target Version.

It is the responsibility of the Customer to verify and validate the upgraded database in order
to detect Bugs, to analyze the impact of changes and new features implemented in the Target Version,
and to convert and adapt for the Target Version any third-party extensions of the Software that
were installed in the database before the upgrade (e.g. non-convered Extra Modules).
The Customer may submit multiple upgrade requests for a database, until an acceptable result is
achieved.

.. _cloud_hosting:

4.4 Cloud Hosting Services
--------------------------

For the duration of this Agreement, when the Customer chooses to use the Cloud Platform,
Odoo SA commits to providing at least the following services:

- Choice of multiple hosting regions (minimum 3: Europe, America, Asia/Pacific)
- Hosting in Tier-III data centers or equivalent, with 99.9% network uptime
- Grade A SSL (HTTPS) Encryption of communication
- Fully automated, verified backups, replicated in multiple regions
- Disaster Recovery Plan, tested regularly

The details of the Cloud Hosting Services are described on the Service Level Agreement page at
https://www.odoo.com/cloud-sla.


.. _support_service:

4.5 Support Services
--------------------

Scope
+++++

For the duration of this Agreement, the Customer may open an unlimited number of support tickets
free of charge, exclusively for questions regarding Bugs (see :ref:`bugfix`) or guidance
with respect to the use of the standard features of the Software and Covered Extra Modules.

Other assistance requests, such as questions related to development or customizations
may be covered through the purchase of a separate service agreement.
In case it’s not clear if a request is covered by this Agreement,
the decision is at the discretion of Odoo SA.

Availability
++++++++++++

Tickets can be submitted via the web form or phone numbers listed on `odoo.com/help <https://www.odoo.com/help>`_,
or when working with an Odoo Partner, the channel provided by the partner, subject to local
opening hours.


.. _maintenance_partner:

4.6 Working with an Odoo Partner
--------------------------------

For bug fixes, support and upgrade services, the Customer may either work with an Odoo Partner
as the main point of contact, or work with Odoo SA directly.

If the Customer decides to work with an Odoo Partner, Odoo SA will subcontract services related
to the Covered Extra Modules to the Odoo Partner, who becomes the main point of contact of the
customer. The Odoo Partner may contact Odoo SA on behalf of the customer for second-level assistance
with regard to standard features of the Software.

If the Customer decides to work with Odoo SA directly, services related to Covered Extra Modules
are provided *if and only if* the Customer is hosted on the Odoo Cloud Platform.


.. _charges:

5 Charges and Fees
==================

.. _charges_standard:

5.1 Standard charges
--------------------

The standard charges for the Odoo Enterprise subscription and the Services are based on the number
of Users and the installed Apps used by the Customer, and specified in writing
at the conclusion of the Agreement.

When during the Term, the Customer has more Users or more installed Apps than specified at the time
of conclusion of this Agreement, the Customer agrees to pay an extra fee equivalent to the applicable
list price (at the beginning of the Term) for the additional Users or Apps, for the remainder of the Term.

In addition, services for Covered Extra Modules are charged based on the number of lines of code
in these modules. When the Customer opts for the maintenance of Covered Extra Modules, the charge
is a monthly fee of 16€ per 100 lines of code (rounded up to the next hundred), unless otherwise
specified in writing at the conclusion of the Agreement. Lines of code will be counted with the ``cloc``
command of the Software, and include all text lines in the source code of those modules, regardless
of the programming language (Python, Javascript, XML, etc.), excluding blank lines, comment lines
and files that are not loaded when installing or executing the Software.

When the Customer requests an upgrade, for each Covered Extra Module that has not been covered by
a maintenance fee for the last 12 months, Odoo SA may charge a one-time extra fee of 16€ per 100
lines of code, for each missing month of coverage.

.. _charges_renewal:

5.2 Renewal charges
-------------------

Upon renewal as covered in section :ref:`term`, if the charges applied during the previous Term
(excluding any “Initial User Discounts”)
are lower than the most current applicable list price, these charges will increase by up to 7%.

.. _taxes:

5.3 Taxes
---------

.. FIXME : extra section, not sure we need it?

All fees and charges are exclusive of all applicable federal, provincial, state, local or other
governmental taxes, fees or charges (collectively, "Taxes"). The Customer is responsible for paying
all Taxes associated with purchases made by the Customer under this Agreement, except when Odoo SA
is legally obliged to pay or collect Taxes for which the Customer is responsible.

    affairs, products, developments, trade secrets, know-how, personnel, customers and suppliers of
