This is done by creating an expense, referencing the :abbr:`SO (Sales Order)` the expense should be added to, and then creating the expense report. Next, managers approve the expense report, and the accounting department posts the journal entries. Finally, once the expense report is posted to a journal, the expense(s) appears on the :abbr:`SO (Sales Order)` that was referenced. The sales order can then be invoiced, thus invoicing the customer for the expense."
