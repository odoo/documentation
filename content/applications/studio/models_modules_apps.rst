Models, modules, and apps
=========================

Models determine the logical structure of a database and how data is stored, organized, and
manipulated. In other words, a model is a table of information that can be linked with other tables.
A model usually represents a business concept, such as a *sales order*, *contact*, or *product*.

Modules and apps contain various elements, such as models, views, data files, web controllers, and
static web data.

.. note::
   All apps are modules. Larger, standalone modules are typically referred to as apps, whereas other
   modules usually serve as add-ons to said apps.

Suggested features
==================

When you create a new model or app with Studio, you can choose to add up to 14 features to speed
up the creation process. These features bundle fields, default settings, and views that are usually
used together to provide some standard functionality. Most of these features can be added later on,
but adding them from the start makes the model creation process much easier. Furthermore, these
features interact together in some cases to increase their usefulness.

.. example::
   Creating a model with the :ref:`studio/models-modules-apps/suggested-features/picture` and
   :ref:`studio/models-modules-apps/suggested-features/pipeline-stages` features enabled adds the
   image in the card layout of the :ref:`Kanban view <studio/views/multiple-records/kanban>`.

.. _studio/export-import:

Export and import customizations
================================

When you do any customization with Studio, a new module named :guilabel:`Studio customizations` is
added to your database.

To export these customizations, go to :menuselection:`Main dashboard --> Studio --> Customizations
--> Export` to download a ZIP file containing all customizations.

To import and install these customizations in another database, connect to the destination database
and go to :menuselection:`Main dashboard --> Studio --> Customizations --> Import`, then upload
the exported ZIP file before clicking on the :guilabel:`Import` button.

.. warning::
   Before importing, make sure the destination database contains the same apps and modules as the
   source database. Studio does not add the underlying modules as dependencies of the exported
   module.
