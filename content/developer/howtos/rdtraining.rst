Getting started
===============

Welcome to the Getting Started Odoo tutorial! If you reached this page that means you are
interested in the development of your own Odoo module. It might also mean that you recently
joined the Odoo company for a rather technical position. In any case, your journey to the
technical side of Odoo starts here.

This training is split in two parts:

- The first part is the :ref:`core training <howtos/rdtraining/core_training>`. Its objective is to
  give you an insight of the most important parts of the Odoo development framework. The chapters
  should be followed in their given order since they cover the development of a new Odoo application
  from scratch in an incremental way. In other words, each chapter depends on the previous one.
- The second part covers a set of :ref:`advanced topics <howtos/rdtraining/advanced_topics>`. Each
  topic can be followed independently, but requires the :ref:`core training
  <howtos/rdtraining/core_training>`.

.. attention::
   Are you following this training as part of your technical onboarding as an Odoo employee? Then,
   we ask you to complete the first part of the training before joining your new team and the second
   part the month after.

All topics are built around a business case we will enhance along the way. The reader is expected
to actively take part in the training by writing the solution for each exercise.

Ready? Let's get started!
