Introduction
============

With the Uruguayan localization, you can generate electronic documents with its XML, fiscal folio,
electronic signature and connection to tax authority Dirección General Impositiva (DGI) through
Uruware.

The supported documents are:

- :guilabel:`e-Invoice`, :guilabel:`e-Invoice Credit Note`, :guilabel:`e-Invoice Debit Note`;
- :guilabel:`e-Ticket`, :guilabel:`e-Ticket Credit Note`, :guilabel:`e-Ticket Debit Note`;
- :guilabel:`Export e-Invoice`, :guilabel:`Export e-Invoice Credit Note`, :guilabel:`Export
  e-Invoice Debit Note`.

The localization requires an Uruware account, which enables users to generate electronic documents
within Odoo.

=============

Modules installation
--------------------

:ref:`Install <general/install>` the following modules to get all the features of the Uruguayan
localization:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 25 50

   * - Name
     - Technical name
     - Description
   * - :guilabel:`Uruguay - Accounting`
     - `l10n_uy`
     - The default :doc:`fiscal localization package <../fiscal_localizations>`. It adds accounting
       characteristics for the Uruguayan localization, which represent the minimum configuration
       required for a company to operate in Uruguay according to the guidelines set by the |DGI|.
       The module's installation automatically loads: chart of accounts, taxes, documents types, and
       tax supported types.
   * - :guilabel:`Uruguay Accounting EDI`
     - `l10n_uy_edi`
     - Includes all the technical and functional requirements to generate and validate
       :doc:`Electronics Documents <../accounting/customer_invoices/electronic_invoicing>`, based on
       the technical documentation published by the |DGI|. The authorized documents are :ref:`listed
       above <uruguay/intro>`.

.. note::
   Odoo automatically installs the base module **Uruguay - Accounting** when a database is installed
   with `Uruguay` selected as the country. However, to enable electronic invoicing, the **Uruguay
   Accounting EDI** (`l10n_uy_edi`) module needs to be manually :ref:`installed <general/install>`.

Company
-------

To configure your company information, open the **Settings** app, scroll down to the
:guilabel:`Companies` section, click :guilabel:`Update Info`, and configure the following:

- :guilabel:`Company Name`
- :guilabel:`Address`, including the :guilabel:`Street`, :guilabel:`City`, :guilabel:`State`,
  :guilabel:`ZIP`, and :guilabel:`Country`
- :guilabel:`Tax ID`: enter the identification number for the selected taxpayer type.
- :guilabel:`DGI Main Branch Code`: this is part of the XML when creating an electronic document. If
  this field is not set, all electronic documents will be rejected.

  To find the :guilabel:`DGI Main Branch Code`, follow these steps:

  #. From your `DGI account <https://servicios.dgi.gub.uy/serviciosenlinea>`_, go to
     :menuselection:`Servicios en línea DGI --> Registro único tributario --> Consulta de datos`.
  #. Select :menuselection:`Consulta de Datos Registrales --> Consulta de Datos de Entidades`.
  #. Open the generated PDF to get the *DGI Main Branch Code* from the :guilabel:`Domicilio Fiscal
     Número de Local` section.

After configuring the company in the database settings, navigate to :menuselection:`Contacts` and
search for your company to verify the following:

- the company type is set to :guilabel:`Company`.
- the :guilabel:`Identification Number` :guilabel:`Type` is :guilabel:`RUT / RUC`.

.. _l10n_uy/uruware-account:

Set up a Uruware account
------------------------

To set up a Uruware account, first be sure to have a valid Odoo subscription. Then follow the
proceeding steps.

Locate the Uruware credentials settings by navigating to the :menuselection:`Accounting -->
Configuration --> Settings`. Scroll down to the :guilabel:`Uruguayan Localization` section and click
on :guilabel:`Create Uruware Account`.

Upon doing so, an email is sent to the address associated with your Odoo subscription with the
username and password to enter Uruware's portal and set up your account.

.. tip::
   Your :guilabel:`Tax ID` needs to be setup to be able to create your account.

.. note::
   This action will create an account with Uruware with the following information:

   - Legal name (razón social)
   - RUT from the company
   - User name (RUT.odoo)
   - Odoo database link

   To ensure your account is created correctly, please add any missing information from above.

Once the account is created, a confirmation email is sent to the email linked to your subscription
in Odoo, containing the credentials to configure the account directly in the Uruware
`testing portal <https://odootest.ucfe.com.uy/Gestion/>`_ or
`production portal <https://prod6109.ucfe.com.uy/Gestion/>`_:

Use the account credentials in the email to log in to the portal.

.. important::
   Be sure to configure two accounts, one for testing and one for production. The email address can
   be changed in Uruware and the same can be used in both environments.

Electronic invoice data
-----------------------

To configure the electronic invoice data, an environment and credentials need to be configured. To
do so, navigate to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings` and scroll down to the
:guilabel:`Uruguayan Localization` section.

First, select the :guilabel:`UCFE Web Services` environment:

- :guilabel:`Production`: for production databases. In this mode, electronic documents are sent to
  |DGI| through Uruware for their validation.
- :guilabel:`Testing`: for test databases. In this mode, the direct connection flows can be tested,
  with the files sent to the |DGI| testing environment through Uruware.
- :guilabel:`Demo`: files are created and accepted automatically in demo mode but are **not** sent
  to the |DGI|. For this reason, rejection errors will not appear in this mode. Every internal
  validation can be tested in demo mode. Avoid selecting this option in a production database.

Then, enter the :guilabel:`Uruware Data`:

- :guilabel:`Uruware WS Password`
- :guilabel:`Commerce Code`
- :guilabel:`Terminal Code`

.. image:: uruguay/electronic-invoice-data.png
   :alt: Required information for electronic invoice.

.. note::
   This data can be obtained from the Uruware portal, after configuring the :ref:`Uruware account
   <l10n_uy/uruware-account>`. The :guilabel:`Uruware WS Password` differs from the password you use
   to enter your Uruware account.

Master data
-----------

Chart of accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :doc:`chart of accounts <../accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts>` is installed by default
as part of the set of data included in the localization module, the accounts are mapped
automatically in taxes, default accounts payable, and default accounts receivable.

Accounts can be added or deleted according to the company's needs.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`../accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts`

Contacts
~~~~~~~~

To create a contact, navigate to :menuselection:`Contacts app` and select :guilabel:`New`. Then
enter the following information:

- :guilabel:`Company Name`
- :guilabel:`Address`:

  - :guilabel:`Street`: required to confirm an electronic invoice.
  - :guilabel:`City`
  - :guilabel:`State`
  - :guilabel:`ZIP`
  - :guilabel:`Country`: required to confirm an electronic invoice.

   :alt: Taxes for Uruguay.

Document types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some accounting transactions, like *customer invoices* and *vendor bills* are classified by document
types. These are defined by the government fiscal authorities, in this case by the |DGI|.

Each document type can have a unique sequence per journal where it is assigned. The data is created
automatically when the localization module is installed, and the information required for the
document types is included by default.

To review the document types included in the localization, navigate to :menuselection:`Accounting
--> Configuration --> Document Types`.

.. note::
   In Uruguay, |CAEs| **must** be uploaded in Uruware. Sequences (and PDFs) are received in Odoo
   from Uruware, based on their |CAEs|. |CAEs| are **only** used in production. When testing, only a
   range of sequences used in Uruware need to be set.

.. image:: uruguay/document-types.png
   :alt: Document types for Uruguay.

Sales journals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To generate and confirm an electronic document that will be validated by |DGI|, the sales journal
needs to be configured with the following:

- :guilabel:`Invoicing Type`: by default :guilabel:`Electronic` option is set. This is necessary to
  send electronic documents via web service to the Uruguayan government through Uruware. The other
  option, :guilabel:`Manual`, is for open invoices previously stamped in another system, for
  example, in the |DGI|.
- :guilabel:`Use Documents?`: Activate this option if this journal will use documents from the list
  of document types in Odoo.

Workflows
=========

Once you have configured your database, you can create your documents.

Sales documents
