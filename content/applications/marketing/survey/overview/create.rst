Get Started with Surveys
========================

Surveys can be used for a range of purposes that can go from collecting customer feedback, evaluate
the success of an event, measure how pleased customers are with your products/services, gauge
whether employees are happy and satisfied with their work environment, and even to find out what
your market is thinking.

Get started
===========

When creating your survey, choose a *Title* and *Category*. The *Category* field is used to know in
which context the survey is being conducted, as different applications might use it for different
purposes such as recruitment, certification, or employee appraisal.

Tab: Questions
--------------

| Add sections and questions by clicking on the respective links.
| On the *Sections and Questions* form, once the question type is chosen and the answer added,
  under the tab *Options*, enable *Mandatory Answer*, and set an *Error message* to be shown
  when the user tries to submit the survey without answering the respective question.
| Depending on the *Question Type*, the tab *Options* aggregates extra and different
  possibilities. Examples:

- *Single Line Text Box* - can choose a minimum and maximum text length (number of characters -
  spaces do not count), and its error message.
- *Multiple choice: multiple answers allowed*: choose between radio buttons or a dropdown menu
  list, and if you would like to have a comment field. If the user select an answer and type a
  comment, the values are separately recorded. Or, enable the comment field to be
  displayed as an answer choice, with which a text type field is displayed.
- *Matrix Type*: choose if you would like to have one or multiple choices per row.
