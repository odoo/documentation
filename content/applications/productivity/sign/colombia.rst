Legal framework for electronic signatures in Colombia
=====================================================

In Colombia, electronic signatures are regulated under the `Law 529 of 1999 <https://www.funcionpublica.gov.co/eva/gestornormativo/norma.php?i=4276#:~:text=%E2%80%9CPor%20medio%20de%20la%20cual,y%20se%20dictan%20otras%20disposiciones.%E2%80%9D>`_.
The law establishes the legal basis for acknowledging electronic records, contracts, and signatures.
The key points of the law include:

- **Legal recognition**: electronic signatures are legally equivalent to handwritten signatures if
  they meet certain criteria.
- **Reliability and security**: electronic signatures must be created with a secure method that can
  reliably identify the signatory and ensure the integrity of the signed document.
- **Certified electronic signatures**: special electronic signature that incorporates certificates
  issued by a recognized certification authority. In some cases, only the certified electronic
  signature has legal and juridical validity in Colombia. In those cases, simple electronic
  signatures like the Odoo Signature only work as a proof of the agreement to celebrate the
  corresponding transaction, which will be submitted to the authority's criteria.
