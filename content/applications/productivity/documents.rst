Documents
=========

**Odoo Documents** allows you to store, view, and manage files within Odoo.

Folders and documents are organized into sections accessible from the tree on the left. The
following sections are available:

- :guilabel:`All`: displays all folders and files the user has access to.
- :icon:`fa-building` :guilabel:`Company`: contains folders and files shared across the company.
  Access is determined by the :ref:`access rights <documents/access-rights>` defined for the folder
  and file.
- :icon:`fa-hdd-o` :guilabel:`My Drive`: the user's personal workspace for organizing and accessing
  files and folders they own or have uploaded.
- :icon:`fa-users` :guilabel:`Shared with me`: includes files that have been shared with the user
  but are not part of any parent folder they have access to.
- :icon:`fa-clock-o` :guilabel:`Recent`: shows recently modified files the user has permission
  to view or edit.
- :icon:`fa-trash` :guilabel:`Trash`: stores :ref:`deleted files and folders <documents/deletion-delay>`.

Click a section in the tree to view its contents. Select a folder to open it, :ref:`manage it
<documents/folders>`, and access its files.

Click a file to open it and :ref:`take available actions <documents/documents>`. To close the file,
press **Esc** or click the :icon:`fa-remove` (:guilabel:`close`) icon. You can also drag and drop a
file or folder to move it to another folder or section.

.. tip::
   - Use the :ref:`search bar <search/values>` to quickly find specific items.
   - The :doc:`chatter <discuss/chatter>` tracks changes to folders and files and allows
     communication with internal users and external contacts. Open the :ref:`Details panel
     <documents/details-panel>` to access it.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`Sign documentation <sign>`

Configuration
=============

.. _documents/deletion-delay:

Deletion delay
--------------

By default, items moved to the trash remain there for 30 days before being permanently deleted. To
adjust this delay, go to :menuselection:`Documents --> Configuration --> Settings` and edit the
:guilabel:`Deletion delay (days)` field.

.. _documents/file-centralization:

File centralization
-------------------

File centralization allows for automatically organizing all files associated with a specific app
into dedicated folders. It is enabled by default for each app upon installation. To disable file
centralization, modify the default folder, or configure the tags to be added to the app-specific
files, go to :menuselection:`Documents --> Configuration --> Settings`, and edit the relevant
setting under the :guilabel:`File Centralization` section.

.. tip::
   - File centralization cannot be disabled for :guilabel:`Accounting` documents. A sub-folder is
     automatically created for each journal type (e.g., Sales, Purchase, Bank, etc.), and the
     journal name is added as a tag on each document. Click :guilabel:`Journals` to edit the list of
     journals to synchronize and define their corresponding folders and tags.
   - For :guilabel:`Human Resources` files, a sub-folder is automatically created for each employee,
     and specific tags are added to the files based on the document type (e.g.,
     :guilabel:`Contracts`, :guilabel:`Payslips`, etc.). You can also create additional
     :guilabel:`Employee Subfolders` automatically by entering the desired folder names, separated
     by commas.

.. note::
   - Changing the folder or tags only affects new files; existing files remain unchanged.
   - When file centralization is enabled for an app, deleting a record in that app moves its
     attachments to the trash in the Documents app.

.. _documents/folders:

Folders
=======

You can organize files in folders available in the :icon:`fa-building` :guilabel:`Company` or
:icon:`fa-hdd-o` :guilabel:`My Drive` sections.

To create a folder, select the desired section in the tree, click :guilabel:`New`, and select
:guilabel:`Folder`. In the pop-up, enter the folder's :guilabel:`Name` and click :guilabel:`Save`.
To create a sub-folder, select the parent folder first, then follow the same steps.

.. note::
   Some folders and sub-folders are created automatically based on the :ref:`file centralization
   settings <documents/file-centralization>`.

To manage a folder or sub-folder, select it and click the :icon:`fa-cog` (:guilabel:`Actions`)
icon above the tree. The following options are available in the menu:

  setting is user-specific and does not affect other users' workspaces. You can then use the
  :ref:`Starred filter <search/favorites>` to navigate to your favorite folders quickly.
- :icon:`fa-info-circle` :guilabel:`Info & Tags`: View the folder's :ref:`details
  <documents/details-panel>` and chatter.

  <documents/deletion-delay>`.

  :guilabel:`Add Custom Action` to :ref:`create a new one <reference/actions/server>`.
- :icon:`fa-cog` :guilabel:`Automations`: Create :doc:`automation rules
  </applications/studio/automated_actions>`.

  .. important::
     Setting up automation rules requires activating :doc:`/applications/studio`, which may impact
     your `pricing plan <https://www.odoo.com/pricing>`_.

- :guilabel:`AI Auto-sort`: Use Odoo AI to automatically organize the files in the folder and
  trigger actions based on the provided AI prompt. Add the corresponding actions for your prompt in
  the lower section of the popup. This option requires the **Odoo AI** app to be installed.

.. tip::
   Switch to the list view to:

#. Optionally, select the :ref:`Tags <documents/tags>` to automatically apply to the files
   created through the alias.

.. note::

dropdown menu (identifiable by its placeholder :guilabel:`No linked model`), then select the
desired record.

   adding a file to the Documents app by uploading an attachment automatically adds the
   corresponding record in the :guilabel:`Linked to field` of the file.

.. _documents/access-rights:

Sharing and access rights
=========================

.. note::
   You can only share folders and files and edit their access rights if you have editing rights.

   want to grant access to from the dropdown menu or enter their email address.

#. Click :guilabel:`Share` to grant access (with or without a notification) or :guilabel:`Copy
   Links` to copy the sharing link to the clipboard.

To configure :guilabel:`General access` for :guilabel:`Internal users` or :guilabel:`Access through
link`, select :guilabel:`Viewer`, :guilabel:`Editor`, or :guilabel:`None` (to completely restrict
access). For :guilabel:`Access through link`, you can also specify whether the folder or file should
be :guilabel:`Discoverable` (i.e., accessible through browsing). Click :guilabel:`Save`
to apply the changes, then :guilabel:`Copy Links` to copy the sharing link to the clipboard.

.. note::
   - Each folder and file URL includes the access rights assigned to it. When you share a link to a
     folder, recipients are directed to a dedicated portal where they can view the files in that
     folder, excluding any with restricted access.
   - :doc:`Portal users </applications/general/users/portal>` can access folders and files they have
     permission to view or edit through the customer portal by clicking the :guilabel:`Documents`

  icon, select the desired file, and click :guilabel:`Add from Documents` to add the
  raw file, or :guilabel:`Paste Link(s)` to insert a link to the file (and preserve the document's
  :ref:`access rights <documents/access-rights>`).

- To insert a file from Documents into the :doc:`Odoo rich-text editor
  </applications/essentials/html_editor>`, type `/file`, then select the desired file, and click
  :guilabel:`Add from Documents` to add the raw file, or :guilabel:`Paste Link(s)` to insert a link
  to the file (and preserve the document's :ref:`access rights <documents/access-rights>`).
