Getting started with Recruitment
================================

Organize job postings, easily publish and unpublish openings, view applicants and see the stage in
the hiring process they are in, and see full recruitment metrics all from the
:guilabel:`Recruitment` application.

Applications
============

By Job Positions
----------------

The default view for :guilabel:`Recruitment`, and for :menuselection:`Recruitment --> Applications
--> By Job Positions` displays all the :guilabel:`Job Positions` for the company, regardless of
status. Each :guilabel:`Job Position` card shows the name of the position, and whether or not the
recruitment process has started. Click the :guilabel:`Start Recruitment` smart button to publish the
job listing and begin the recruitment process. Once published, a :guilabel:`Published` banner will
appear in the corner. If a published job position has applicants, a smart button listing to the
applicants appears instead of :guilabel:`Start Recruitment`. Published cards show how many positions
are available to be filled, and how many new applicants there have been. :guilabel:`Publish` and
:guilabel:`Unpublish` a job position by clicking on the publish toggle button. The
:guilabel:`Link Tracker` icon will display any links associated with the job posting, such as a
LinkedIn listing.

All Applications
----------------

To view all applications received, go to :menuselection:`Recruitment --> Applications --> All
Applications`. A kanban view will show all applicants, and organize them by stage. The default
stages are :guilabel:`Initial Qualification`, :guilabel:`First Interview`, :guilabel:`Second
Interview`, and :guilabel:`Contract Proposal`. :guilabel:`Contract Signed` is hidden by default but
can be viewed by clicking :guilabel:`Unfold`. Applicant stages can be changed by moving a card to a
new stage. Each applicant card displays the applicant's name, the name of the job being applied to,
any relevant tags, such as departments, the applicant's photos, any documents attached, a clock icon
to indicate if an activity has been scheduled, and a rating system of stars. Easily schedule an
interview by clicking on the drop down menu of a card, and clicking on :guilabel:`Schedule
Interview`.

Recruitment Analysis

The report for :guilabel:`Recruitment Analysis` provides a breakdown of the applicants for the last
365 days. How many applicants appear on the main chart, with metrics on how many people were hired,
what the recruitment rate was, the referral rate, and how long the typical hiring process lasts. A
pie chart shows where the applicants came from, such as email, direct applications, and various
social media platforms like Facebook or LinkedIn. A breakdown of the detailed application metrics by
position appears at the bottom and the information can be inserted into a spreadsheet for further
analysis.
