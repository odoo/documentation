msgid "The time to load a page is an important criteria for Google. A faster website not only improves your visitor's experience, but Google gives you a better page ranking if your page loads faster than your competitors. Some studies have shown that, if you divide the time to load your pages by two (e.g. 2 seconds instead of 4 seconds), the visitor abandonment rate is also divided by two. (25% to 12.5%). One extra second to load a page could `cost $1.6b to Amazon in sales <http://www.fastcompany.com/1825005/how-one-second-could-cost-amazon-16-billion-sales>`__."

The latency time to transfer a file is usually much longer than the actual data transfer time, for small files like .JS and .CSS. Thus, the time to load CSS resources depends more on the number of requests to be done than the actual file size."
