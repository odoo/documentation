Stimulate customers with quotations deadline
============================================

As you send quotations, it is important to set a quotation deadline;
Both to entice your customer into action with the fear of missing out on
an offer and to protect yourself. You don't want to have to fulfill an
order at a price that is no longer cost effective for you.

Set a deadline
==============

On every quotation or sales order you can add an *Expiration Date*.

Use deadline in templates
=========================

You can also set a default deadline in a *Quotation Template*. Each
time that template is used in a quotation, that deadline is applied. You
can find more info about quotation templates `here
