Confirm an order with a signature
=================================

When you send quotations to clients, they can instantly accept and sign it online. When they
click on **Sign & Pay**, they have the choice to draw their own signature, automatically fill in the
field with an automated signature or load a file from their computer. Here below, it is an example
of an automated signature:

Once signed, you will have the possibility to choose your payment methods. Then, when the quotation
will be paid and confirmed, a delivery order will be created automatically by Odoo.

.. tip::
   Be careful that delivery orders are only generated for storable products and if the
   **Inventory app** is already installed.
