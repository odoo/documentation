Create a Request for Quotation
==============================

A Request for Quotation (RfQ) is used when you plan to purchase some
products and you would like to receive a quote for those products. In
Odoo, the Request for Quotation is used to send your list of desired
products to your supplier. Once your supplier has answered your request,
you can choose to go ahead with the offer and purchase or to turn down
the offer.

the date to which you wish to proceed to the actual order.

In **Products**, click on Add an item. Select the product you wish to order
in the **Product** menu. Specify the **Quantity** by inserting the

Once your supplier has replied with an offer, update the RfQ by clicking
on **Edit** to fit the quotation (prices, taxes, expected delivery lead
time, payment terms, etc.), then click on **Save** to issue a Purchase
Order.

To proceed with the order, click on **Confirm Order** to send the order to
the supplier. The RfQ's status will switch to **Purchase Order**.
