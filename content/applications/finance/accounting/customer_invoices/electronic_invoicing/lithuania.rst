Odoo electronic invoicing in Lithuania
======================================

Odoo Invoicing is your trusted partner for safe, efficient, and legally compliant e-invoicing
solutions tailored to Lithuania's regulatory standards.

Legal framework for e-invoicing in Lithuania
============================================

In Lithuania, e-invoicing is regulated under the `Law on Accounting <https://www.e-tar.lt/portal/lt/legalAct/207ad17030a011e78397ae072f58c508>`_
and aligned with `EU Directive 2014/55/EU <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014L0055>`_
for mandatory :abbr:`B2G (business-to-government)` e-invoicing. Businesses working with public
sector entities must use e-invoicing, and invoices must be submitted through the E.sąskaita
platform, Lithuania’s centralized invoicing system for public procurement. Lithuania also
participates in the Peppol network, enabling seamless cross-border e-invoicing. While B2B
e-invoicing is currently optional, its use is encouraged to enhance tax compliance and operational
efficiency.

Compliance with Lithuanian e-invoicing regulations

  invoices to be stored for a minimum of ten years, Odoo securely archives all invoices in a
  tamper-proof system, ensuring they are accessible for audits and tax inspections.
