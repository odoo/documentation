Add optional products
=====================

The use of optional products is a marketing strategy for cross-selling products along with a core
product. The aim is to offer useful and related products to your customers. For instance, if a
customer wants to buy a car, he has the choice to order an automatic opening trunk and massaging
seats, or not to order such high-quality products and simply buy his car.

Add optional products to your quotations
========================================

With Odoo Sales, it is possible to add or modify optional products directly on quotations
(under the **Optional Products** tab, as you can see below).

In practice, your customers will be able to add different optional products to their order by
using associated carts, with a user-friendly layout. More than that, if a customer selects all the
optional products suggested, these additional items will automatically fill in the quotation
managed by the salesman.

all the better.
