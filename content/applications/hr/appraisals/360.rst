360 Feedback
============

Odoo's **Appraisals** app lets managers gather feedback on their direct reports from anyone in the
company. Input from colleagues gives managers a fuller view of each employee's strengths, growth
areas, and collaboration skills.

Each appraisal, or survey, is presented on its own line on the :guilabel:`360 Feedback` dashboard,
along with various information related to that particular appraisal.

Each appraisal includes the following information:

- :guilabel:`Survey Name`: the name of the specific survey.
- :guilabel:`Responsible`: the employee responsible for the survey, including the month and year
  they were given that designation.
- :guilabel:`Questions`: the number of questions in that particular survey.
- :guilabel:`Average Duration`: the average time a user spends completing the survey.
- :guilabel:`Registered`: the number of people who have been sent the survey.
- :guilabel:`Completed`: the number of people who have completed the survey.
- :guilabel:`Certified`: if the survey is for a certification, the percentage of users who have
  passed the certification.

Each appraisal row offers two actions:

- :guilabel:`Test`: Opens the appraisal in a new tab to preview the questions without submitting
  answers. Close the tab to return to the list, or click :icon:`oi-arrow-right` :guilabel:`Go to
  Survey`/:guilabel:`Go to Appraisal` for the full form.
- :guilabel:`See Results`: :ref:`View response analytics <appraisals/360-view-results>`.
