1.  Purchase orders and sales orders can be related. If a company within
    your group creates a purchase or a sales order, the corresponding
    document is automatically created for your company. All you
    have to do is check that everything is correct and confirm the
    sale. You can automate the validation on your sales and purchase
    orders.

2.  It is also possible to only handle invoices and refunds.
