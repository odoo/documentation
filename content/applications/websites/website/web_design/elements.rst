:ref:`text highlights <website/elements/text_highlights>` to interactive ones such as
:ref:`buttons <website/elements/buttons>` and :ref:`links <website/elements/links>`. Visual elements
like :ref:`images <website/elements/images>`, :ref:`icons <website/elements/icons>`,
:ref:`videos <website/elements/videos>`, and :ref:`animations <website/elements/animations>` can
also be added to improve content presentation and organization.

#. Navigate to the relevant website page and click on :guilabel:`Edit`.
#. Click the section on the page where you want to add or modify an element.

#. Click on :guilabel:`Save`.
