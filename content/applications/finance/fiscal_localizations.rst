Fiscal localization packages
============================

**Fiscal Localization Packages** are country-specific modules that install pre-configured taxes,
fiscal positions, chart of accounts, and legal statements on your database. Some additional
features, such as the configuration of specific certificates, are also added to your Accounting app,
following your fiscal administration requirements.

.. note::
   Odoo continuously adds new localizations and improves the existing packages.

Configuration
-------------

Odoo automatically installs the appropriate package for your company, according to the country
selected at the creation of the database.

.. important::
   As long as you haven't posted any entry, you can still select another package.

To select a fiscal localization package for your company, go to :menuselection:`Accounting -->
Configuration --> Settings --> Fiscal Localization`, select the appropriate package from the list
and save.

taxes you use, and configure your country-specific statements and certifications.
