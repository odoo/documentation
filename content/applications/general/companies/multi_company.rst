.. |mcd| replace:: multi-company database

In Odoo, multiple companies can be configured under one database. This allows some data to be shared
among companies while maintaining some separation between entities.

A centralized management environment allows authorized users to select multiple companies
simultaneously and set their specific warehouses, customers, equipment, and contacts. It also
generates reports of aggregated figures without switching interfaces, facilitating daily tasks and
enhancing the overall management process.

.. warning::
   Enabling multi-company functionality in an Odoo database on a *Standard* plan automatically
   triggers an upsell to the *Custom* plan. This does not apply to databases on the *One-App Free*
   plan.

   - **For yearly or multi-year contracts**: An upsell order is created with a 30-day limit.
   - **For monthly contracts**: The subscription automatically switches to the *Custom* plan and
     the new rate is applied when the next bill is generated.

   For more information, refer to `Odoo's pricing page <https://www.odoo.com/pricing-plan>`_ or
   contact your account manager.

   #. Click :guilabel:`Archive` to confirm.

.. _general/multi-company/multi-company-environment:

Multi-company environment
=========================

In a multi-company environment, users are granted :ref:`access to one or more companies
<general/multi-company/user-access>`, and :ref:`data
<general/multi-company/shared-and-unshared-records>` is created or modified based on its intended
use within that structure.

.. _general/multi-company/user-access:

User access
-----------

A multi-company environment allows flexible control over :ref:`user access <users/multi-companies>`
and :doc:`access rights <../users/access_rights>` that can be granted or restricted as needed.

.. _general/multi-company/company-selector:

Company selector
----------------

To switch between (or select) multiple companies, follow these steps:

#. Click the company selector in the top-right corner of the header menu.
#. In the drop-down list, select the checkboxes next to the desired companies.
#. The highlighted company indicates the current active environment.
#. To switch to another company, click its name in the list of selected companies.

.. example::
   In the example below, the user can access six companies, two of which are selected. The current
   active company is *My Company (San Francisco)*.

.. _general/multi-company/shared-and-unshared-records:

Shared and company-specific records
-----------------------------------

Data, such as products, contacts, and equipment can either be shared across companies or restricted
to a specific company by setting the :guilabel:`Company` field on the relevant records:

- either leave the field blank to make it accessible to all companies;
- or select the company to make it visible to users logged in to that specific company.

Records specifically linked to a particular company are accessible only within that entity. For
instance, quotations, invoices, and vendor bills associated with a company are visible only when
logged into that company, and the corresponding company is automatically selected by default and
displayed in the :guilabel:`Company` field.

In a |mcd|, new products and contacts are shared across companies by default. To restrict them to a
specific company, set the :guilabel:`Company` field on the record's form.

.. _general/multi-company/inter-company-transactions:

Inter-company transactions
==========================

The :guilabel:`Inter-Company Transactions` feature allows one company in the database to sell or
purchase goods and services from another company within the same database. Depending on the
configuration settings, counterpart documents for orders and invoices can be automatically generated
and synchronized.

.. warning::
   To handle inter-company transactions correctly, :doc:`general
   <../../finance/accounting/get_started>` and specific configurations must be set properly,
   including :doc:`fiscal positions <../../finance/accounting/taxes/fiscal_positions>` and
   :doc:`localizations <../../finance/fiscal_localizations>`.

To activate inter-company transactions, select the relevant company in the :ref:`company selector
<general/multi-company/company-selector>`, open the Settings app, navigate to the
:guilabel:`Companies` section, enable :guilabel:`Inter-Company Transactions`, and :guilabel:`Save`.
Then, choose one of the following :guilabel:`Rule` options to create a counterpart for the selected
company:

- :guilabel:`Do not synchronize`: Do not synchronize any inter-company transactions.
- :guilabel:`Synchronized invoice/bills`: Generate a bill/invoice when a company confirms a
  bill/invoice for the selected company.
- :guilabel:`Synchronize Sales Order`: Generate a quotation (drafted sales order) when a sales order
  is confirmed for the selected company. To generate a validated sales order instead of a quotation,
  enable :guilabel:`Automatic Validation`.\*
- :guilabel:`Synchronize Purchase Order`: Generate a request for quotation (drafted purchase order)
  using the selected company warehouse in the :guilabel:`Use Warehouse` field when a purchase order
  is confirmed for the selected company. To generate a validated purchase order instead of a request
  for quotation, enable :guilabel:`Automatic Validation`.\*
- :guilabel:`Synchronize Sales and Purchase Order`: Generate a drafted purchase/sales order using
  the selected company warehouse in the :guilabel:`Use Warehouse` field when a sales/purchase order
  is confirmed for the selected company. To generate a validated purchase/sales order instead of a
  draft one, enable :guilabel:`Automatic Validation`.\*

  \* This rule option needs to be selected for :guilabel:`Automatic Validation` to appear in the
  configuration.

.. note::
   For inter-company transactions, the :ref:`products must be shared
   <general/multi-company/shared-and-unshared-records>` among the involved companies.

.. example::
   :guilabel:`Synchronize invoices/bills`: when an invoice for :guilabel:`Customer` `JS Store US` is
   posted on `JS Store Belgium`, a vendor bill is automatically created in `JS Store US`.

   :guilabel:`Synchronize sales/purchase order`: when a sales order for :guilabel:`Customer` `JS
   Store US` is confirmed on `JS Store Belgium`, a purchase order on `JS Store US` is automatically
   created (and confirmed if the :guilabel:`Automatic Validation` feature is enabled).

.. _general/multi-company/use-cases:

Use cases
=========

.. _general/multi-company/use-cases-multinational-companies:

Multinational companies
-----------------------

A multinational retail chain operating in the United States and Canada must manage transactions in
USD and CAD.

Since each country has its own tax laws and regulations, using Odooâ€™s multi-company feature is
highly beneficial.

This setup allows for inter-company transactions, which is essential for managing cross-border
inventory transfers. It also simplifies the sales process by enabling customers transactions in
their local currency.

.. _general/multi-company/use-cases-seperate-processes:

Separate processes
------------------

A small furniture company is launching a new product line that requires separate procurement,
inventory, and manufacturing workflows. These new products differ significantly from the existing
catalog. To manage this efficiently, the company is considering using the multi-company feature to
manage the new line as a separate business entity.

However, creating a completely new company might add unnecessary complexity to the database.
Instead, the company can leverage existing features such as :doc:`analytic accounting
<../../finance/accounting/reporting/analytic_accounting>` and multiple warehouses to manage the new
product line without complicating overall operations.
