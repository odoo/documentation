Odoo CRM Terminologies
======================

-  **CRM (Customer relationship management)**: 
        System for managing a
        company's interactions with current and future customers. It
        often involves using technology to organize, automate, and
        synchronize sales, marketing, customer service, and technical
        support.

-  **Sales cycle** : 
        Sequence of phases used by a company to convert a
        prospect into a customer.

-  **Pipeline :** 
        Visual representation of your sales process, from the
        first contact to the final sale. It refers to the process by
        which you generate, qualify and close leads through your sales
        cycle.

-  **Sales stage** : 
        In Odoo CRM, a stage defines where an opportunity
        is in your sales cycle and its probability to close a sale.

-  **Lead :** 
        Someone who becomes aware of your company or someone who
        you decide to pursue for a sale, even if they don't know about
        your company yet.

-  **Opportunity :** 
        A lead that has shown an interest in knowing more
        about your products/services and therefore has been handed over
        to a sales representative

-  **Customer :** 
        In Odoo CRM, a customer refers to any contact within
        your database, whether it is a lead, an opportunity, a client or
        a company.

-  **Key Performance Indicator (KPI)** : 
        A KPI is a measurable value
        that demonstrates how effectively a company is achieving key
        business objectives. Organizations use KPIs to evaluate their
        success at reaching targets.

-  **Lead scoring** : 
        System assigning a positive or negative score to
        prospects according to their web activity and personal
        informations in order to determine whether they are "ready for
        sales" or not.

-  **Kanban view :** 
        In Odoo, the Kanban view is a workflow
        visualisation tool halfway between a `list
        view <https://www.odoo.com/documentation/11.0/reference/views.html#lists>`__
        and a non-editable `form
        view <https://www.odoo.com/documentation/11.0/reference/views.html#forms>`__
        and displaying records as "cards". Records may be grouped in
        columns for use in workflow visualisation or manipulation (e.g.
        tasks or work-progress management), or ungrouped (used simply to
        visualize records).

-  **List view :** 
        View allowing you to see your objects (contacts,
        companies, tasks, etc.) listed in a table.

-  **Lead generation:** 
        Process by which a company collects relevant
        datas about potential customers in order to enable a relationship
        and to push them further down the sales cycle.

-  **Campaign:** 
        Coordinated set of actions sent via various channels to
        a target audience and whose goal is to generate leads. In Odoo
        CRM, you can link a lead to the campaign which he comes from in
        order to measure its efficiency.
