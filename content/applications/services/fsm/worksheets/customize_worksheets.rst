descriptions of the work for each type of intervention. It speeds up the flow for your employees
while giving customers a detailed summary, which can be reviewed and signed onsite.

Enable the feature
==================
Go to :menuselection:`Field Service --> Configuration` and enable

With the freedom of *Studio*, drag and drop fields to create a report tailored to your needs.
Once you are done, click on *Close* and get an overview of the work done.

*Worksheets* is where you can see how many times the worksheet has been used/completed under a task.
*Analysis* examines all the worksheets under that given template and generates a graph.
