===========================
Manage multiple sales teams
===========================

In Odoo, you can manage several sales teams, departments or channels
with specific sales processes. To do so, we use the concept of *Sales
Channel*.

Create a new sales team
==========================

To create a new *Sales Team*, go to :menuselection:`Configuration --> Sales Teams`.

There you can set an email alias to it. Every message sent to that email
address will create a lead/opportunity.

Add members to your sales team
---------------------------------

You can add members to any team; that way those members will see the
pipeline structure of the sales team when opening it. Any
lead/opportunity assigned to them will link to the sales team.
Therefore, you can only be a member of one team.

This will ease the process review of the team manager.

If you now filter on this specific team in your pipeline, you will
find all of its opportunities.

Sales team dashboard
=======================

To see the operations and results of any sales team at a glance, the
sales manager also has access to the *Sales Team Dashboard* under
*Reporting*.

It is shared with the whole ecosystem so every revenue stream is
included in it: Sales, eCommerce, PoS, etc.
