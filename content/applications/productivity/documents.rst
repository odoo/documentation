Configuration
=============

By going to :menuselection:`Documents --> Configuration --> Settings`, you can enable the
centralization of files attached to a specific area of your activity. For example, by ticking
:guilabel:`Human Resources`, your HR documents are automatically available in the HR workspace,
while documents related to Payroll are automatically available in the Payroll sub-workspace. You
can change the default workspace using the dropdown menu and edit its properties by clicking the
:icon:`fa-arrow-right` (:guilabel:`Internal link`) icon.

.. note::
   - If you enable the centralization of your accounting files and documents, it is necessary to
     click on :guilabel:`Journals` and define each journal independently to allow automatic
     synchronization.

   - If you select a new workspace, existing documents are not moved. Only newly created documents
     will be found under the new workspace.

.. _documents/workspaces:

Workspaces
==========

Workspaces are hierarchical folders having their own set of :ref:`tags <documents/tags>`
and :ref:`actions <documents/workflow-actions>`. Default workspaces exist, but you can create your
own by going to :menuselection:`Documents --> Configuration --> Workspaces` and clicking
:guilabel:`New`. On the new page, fill in the following information:

- :guilabel:`Name`
- :guilabel:`Parent Workspace`: if you want to create a sub-workspace, select its :guilabel:`Parent
  Workspace`.

Three tabs are available: :ref:`Tags <documents/tags>`,
:ref:`Access Rights <documents/access-rights>`, and :ref:`Description <documents/description>`.

.. _documents/tags:

Tags
----

Tags are used within workspaces to add a level of differentiation between documents. They are
organized per category, and filters can be used to sort them.

From the :guilabel:`Tags` tab, click :guilabel:`Add a line`, create the :guilabel:`Tag Category`,
and :guilabel:`Name` your tags.

.. note::
   - The tags of a parent workspace apply to the child workspaces automatically;
   - Tags can be created and modified by going to :menuselection:`Documents --> Configuration -->
     Tags`;
   - Tags can also be created or edited by clicking the :icon:`fa-gear` (:guilabel:`gear`) icon on
     the left panel;
   - An :ref:`email alias <documents/upload>` can be used to automatically send received documents
     to a specific workspace based on the tag assigned.

.. _documents/access-rights:

Access rights
-------------

To manage your workspace access rights, go to the :guilabel:`Access Rights` tab. You can add
:guilabel:`Write Groups` that can view, create, and edit the workspace's documents. You can also add
:guilabel:`Read Groups` that only view the workspace's documents.

.. tip::
   Enable :guilabel:`Own Documents Only` to limit :guilabel:`Read Groups` and
   :guilabel:`Write Groups` to the documents of which they are owner.

.. _documents/description:

Description
-----------

You can add descriptive information to your workspace by going to the :guilabel:`Description` tab.

.. note::
   Workspaces can also be created and edited by clicking the :icon:`fa-gear` (:guilabel:`gear`) icon
   on the left panel.

.. _documents/management:

Documents management
====================

When selecting or opening a document, the right panel displays different options, including, for
example:

- :icon:`fa-download` (:guilabel:`Download`);
- :icon:`fa-share-alt` (:guilabel:`Share this selection`): a share URL is copied to your clipboard;
- :icon:`fa-retweet` (:guilabel:`Replace`): select a new file to replace the existing one. Scroll
  down to the bottom of the right panel to see the :guilabel:`History` and :guilabel:`restore`,
  :guilabel:`download`, or :guilabel:`delete` the document;
- :icon:`fa-unlock` (:guilabel:`Lock`);
- :icon:`fa-scissors` (:ref:`Split <documents/split>`);
- :icon:`fa-comments` (:guilabel:`Open chatter`).

To modify the name of your file, edit the :guilabel:`Name` field. Click the :icon:`fa-trash`
(:guilabel:`Move to trash`) icon to delete your document.

.. note::
   Items moved to the trash are kept for 30 days in the :icon:`fa-trash` :guilabel:`Trash`
   workspace, after which they are permanently deleted.

A :guilabel:`Contact` or an :guilabel:`Owner` can be assigned. You can also modify the related
:guilabel:`Workspace` and add :guilabel:`Tags`.

.. note::
   - The :guilabel:`Contact` is a person related to the document who only has read
     :ref:`access rights <documents/access-rights>` to the document, e.g., an existing supplier in
     your database;
   - The creator of a document is automatically assigned as its :guilabel:`Owner` and is granted
     full access rights to it. To replace the owner of a document, select the required user from the
     dropdown list in the :guilabel:`Owner` field.

.. tip::
   An employee must be a user and the owner of a document to view it in **My Profile**.

Different :ref:`Actions <documents/workflow-actions>` are available at the bottom of the right
panel, depending on the workspace where your document is stored.

.. _documents/split:

Split PDF documents
-------------------

Select the PDF you want to split, and click the :icon:`fa-scissors` (:guilabel:`scissors`) icon. A
new view displays all the pages of the document.

By default, all pages are split when you click :guilabel:`Split`. To remove a split between two
pages, click the :icon:`fa-scissors` (:guilabel:`scissors`) icon.

.. image:: documents/split-pdf.png
   :alt: split your documents

.. tip::
   To merge documents from your dashboard, select them and click the :icon:`fa-scissors`
   (:guilabel:`scissors`) icon. Click on the scissors between the two documents and click
   :guilabel:`Split` to merge the documents.

Additional features
-------------------

Select a workspace and click the :guilabel:`New` button to access additional features:

Upload
~~~~~~

You can upload any file (max 64MB per file on Odoo Online) to your **Documents** app. Select the
workspace where you want to upload your file, click the :guilabel:`New` button, then
:icon:`fa-upload` :guilabel:`Upload`.

Request
~~~~~~~

You can request files and organize them as documents to remind users to download them.

Select the workspace where the file should be stored, click the :guilabel:`New` button, then
:icon:`fa-paper-plane-o` :guilabel:`Request`. Add the :guilabel:`Document Name` and select the
person you need it from in the :guilabel:`Request To` field. You can also fill in the
:guilabel:`Due Date In`, confirm the :guilabel:`Workspace` the document should belong to, and add
:guilabel:`Tags` and a :guilabel:`Message`. Then, click :guilabel:`Request`. A placeholder for the
missing document is created in the workspace.

When your document is available, click the placeholder to upload it.

You can see all missing documents by going to the **Activity** view and the :guilabel:`Requested
Document` column.

.. tip::
   From the :guilabel:`Activity` view, you can send a **reminder email** to users from whom you are
   expecting a document. Go to the :guilabel:`Requested Document` column and click the
   :icon:`fa-ellipsis-v` (:guilabel:`ellipsis`) icon, and :guilabel:`Document Request: Reminder`.
   Click on a date to see the details of a specific request. You can update it by clicking on the
   :icon:`fa-pencil` (:guilabel:`pen`) icon, :guilabel:`Preview` the content of the reminder email,

To create a new :doc:`spreadsheet <spreadsheet>`, select the workspace where the file should be
stored, click the :guilabel:`New` button, then :guilabel:`Spreadsheet`. You can create a
:guilabel:`Blank spreadsheet` or select an :doc:`existing template <spreadsheet/templates>` to use.

Share
-----

You can make a document or a workspace accessible to anyone by sharing a URL.

Share a document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To generate a **share link** to a document, select the document and click the :guilabel:`Share`
button.

In the pop-up, you can :guilabel:`Name` the share link, set a validity date by filling in the
:guilabel:`Valid Until` field, and if you own more than one site, select the :guilabel:`Website` you
want so the right domain name is reflected in the URL.

Click :guilabel:`Copy Link & Close` to copy the URL to your clipboard.

.. tip::
   You can also generate a share URL by selecting the document, going to the right panel, and
   clicking the :icon:`fa-share-alt` (:guilabel:`Share this selection`) icon.

Share a workspace
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can share a link to a workspace and allow users to :guilabel:`Download` its content or
:guilabel:`Download and Upload` files to it.

To do so, go to the left column of your dashboard and select the workspace you want to share. You
can also choose one or more tags that will be automatically added to the uploaded documents. Then,
click the :guilabel:`Share` button.

In the pop-up, a share :guilabel:`URL` you can :guilabel:`Copy` is displayed. You can
:guilabel:`Name` your share link and set a validity date by filling in the :guilabel:`Valid Until`
field. If you own more than one site, select the :guilabel:`Website` you want so the share link
reflects the right domain name.

.. Note::
   - The links added to your workspace using the :ref:`Link <documents/add-a-link>` option cannot be
     shared and are, therefore, excluded.
   - When tags are applied to a shared workspace, users can exclusively access the documents
     associated with those tags.

.. _documents/upload:

Files upload
************

Toggle the :guilabel:`Allow upload` switch to allow users to upload files to your workspace.

Tick the :guilabel:`Upload by Email` checkbox to enable users to upload documents sent by email in
the workspace.

Enter an alias in the :guilabel:`Email Alias` field. All documents sent to this email address are
uploaded to the workspace using the chosen tags.

.. note::
   - You need to have an alias domain set to be able to upload documents by email. If it isn't
     existing yet, click :guilabel:`Choose or Configure Email Servers` and create an
     :ref:`alias domain <email-outbound-alias-domain>`.
   - By default, the :guilabel:`Document Owner` is the person who uploads a file to a workspace, but
     you can select another user. You can also set a :guilabel:`Contact`, usually an external
     person, such as a partner.
   - Enable :guilabel:`Create a new activity` to automatically create an activity when a document is
     uploaded. Select the :guilabel:`Activity type` from the dropdown list and set the
     :guilabel:`Due Date In` field. You can also add a :guilabel:`Summary` and a
     :guilabel:`Responsible` person assigned to the activity.

.. tip::
   Go to :menuselection:`Configuration --> Share & Emails` to see and manage your share links.
   Select a line and click :guilabel:`Delete` to disable the URL. People who have received this
   link will no longer be able to access the document(s) or workspace.

.. _documents/workflow-actions:

Workflow actions
================

Workflow actions help manage documents and overall business operations. These are automated actions
that can be created and customized for each workspace. With a single click you can, for example,
create, move, sign, add tags to a document, and process bills.

When a document meets the set criteria, these workflow actions appear on the right panel.

Create workflow actions
-----------------------

To update an existing workflow action or create a new one, go to :menuselection:`Documents -->
Configuration --> Actions` and click :guilabel:`New`.

.. note::
   An action applies to all **sub-workspaces** under the :guilabel:`Related Workspace` you selected.

Set the conditions
------------------

Define the :guilabel:`Action Name` and then set the conditions that trigger the appearance of the
action button on the right-side panel when selecting a file.

There are three basic types of conditions you can set:

#. :guilabel:`Tags`: you can use the :guilabel:`Contains` and :guilabel:`Does not contain`
   conditions, meaning the files *must have* or *must not have* the tags set here;

#. :guilabel:`Contact`: the files must be associated with the contact set here;

#. :guilabel:`Owner`: the files must be associated with the owner set here.

.. image:: documents/basic-condition-example.png
   :alt: Example of a workflow action's basic condition in Odoo Documents

.. tip::
   If you do not set any conditions, the action button appears for all files inside the selected
   workspace.

Advanced condition type: domain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::
   It is recommended to have some knowledge of Odoo development to configure *Domain* filters
   properly.

The :ref:`developer mode <developer-mode>` needs to be activated to enable the :guilabel:`Domain`
:guilabel:`Condition type`. Once done, click :guilabel:`New Rule`.

To create a rule, you typically select a :guilabel:`field`, an :guilabel:`operator`, and a
:guilabel:`value`. For example, if you want to add a workflow action to all the PDF files inside a
workspace, set the :guilabel:`field` to *Mime Type*, the :guilabel:`operator` to *contains*, and the
pdf :guilabel:`value`.

.. image:: documents/domain-condition-example.png
   :alt: Example of a workflow action's domain condition in Odoo Documents

Click the :icon:`fa-plus` (:guilabel:`Add New Rule`) icon and the :icon:`fa-sitemap`
(:guilabel:`Add branch`) icon to add conditions and sub-conditions. You can then specify if your
rule should match :guilabel:`all` or :guilabel:`any` conditions. You can also edit the rule directly
using the :guilabel:`Code editor`.

Configure the actions
---------------------

Go to the :guilabel:`Actions` section to set up your action. You can simultaneously:

- **Move to Workspace**: move the file to any workspace;
