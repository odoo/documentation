# REDIRECT RULES #

# Each line in this file specifies a redirect rule that redirects users from one URL to another.
#
# Redirect rules must follow this pattern: old_file.rst new_file.rst  # optional comment
# Both parts are file paths and must thus include the full path of the file starting from the root
# of the documentation to the file name, including the .rst extension.
# If you consider it necessary, add a comment after the symbol '#' to explain why the redirection is
# needed.
#
# A redirect rule must be added to this file in the following cases:
#
#   1. An RST file is moved from one location to another.
#      Example: The documentation of the Sales app is moved from sale_app/ to sales/ .
#      Rules: sale_app/send_quotations.rst sales/send_quotations.rst
#             sale_app/send_quotations/quote_template.rst sales/send_quotations/quote_template.rst
#             sale_app/invoicing.rst sales/invoicing.rst  # ...and so on.
#
#   2. An RST file is renamed.
#      Example: The file create_quotations.rst in sales/ is renamed to quotations.rst.
#      Rule: sales/create_quotations.rst sales/quotations.rst # no longer limited to creating quotes
#
# Write your rules in the section below corresponding to your target version. All rules are active
# no matter the version. The section's only purpose is to help with the triage.
# Consider indicating the reference of the PR (#123) that made a rule necessary, if any.
