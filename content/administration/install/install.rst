Installing Odoo
===============

There are multiple ways to install Odoo, or not install it at all, depending
on the intended use case.

This documents attempts to describe most of the installation options.

:ref:`setup/install/online`
    The easiest way to use Odoo in production or to try it.

:ref:`setup/install/packaged`
    Suitable for testing Odoo, developing modules and can be used for
    long-term production use with additional deployment and maintenance work.

:ref:`setup/install/source`
    Provides greater flexibility:  e.g. allow multiple running Odoo versions on
    the same system. Good for developing modules, can be used as base for
    production deployment.

:ref:`setup/install/docker`
    If you usually use docker_ for development or deployment, an official
    docker_ base image is available.


.. _setup/install/editions:

Editions
========

There are two different Editions_ of Odoo: the Community and Enterprise versions.
Using the Enterprise version is possible on `Odoo Online`_ and accessing the code is
restricted to Enterprise customers and partners. The Community version is freely
available to anyone.

If you already use the Community version and wish to upgrade to Enterprise, please
refer to :ref:`setup/enterprise` (except for :ref:`setup/install/source`).


.. _setup/install/online:

Online
======

Demo
----

To simply get a quick idea of Odoo, demo_ instances are available. They are
shared instances which only live for a few hours, and can be used to browse
around and try things out with no commitment.

Demo_ instances require no local installation, just a web browser.

Odoo Online
-----------

Trivial to start with, fully managed and migrated by Odoo S.A., `Odoo Online`_
provides private instances and starts out free. It can be used to discover and
test Odoo and do non-code customizations (i.e. incompatible with custom modules
or the Odoo Apps Store) without having to install it locally.

Can be used for both testing Odoo and long-term production use.

Like demo_ instances, `Odoo Online`_ instances require no local installation, a web
browser is sufficient.


.. _setup/install/packaged:

Packaged installers
===================

Odoo provides packaged installers for Windows, deb-based distributions
(Debian, Ubuntu, …) and RPM-based distributions (Fedora, CentOS, RHEL, …) for
both the Community and Enterprise versions.

These packages automatically set up all dependencies (for the Community version),
but may be difficult to keep up-to-date.

Official Community packages with all relevant dependency requirements are
available on our nightly_ server. Both Community and Enterprise packages can
be downloaded from our download_ page (you must to be logged in as a paying
customer or partner to download the Enterprise packages).

Windows
-------

#. Download the installer from our nightly_ server (Community only) or the Windows installer from
   the download_ page (any edition).
#. Execute the downloaded file.

   .. warning::
      | On Windows 8 and later you may see a warning titled "Windows protected your PC".
      | Click on **More Info** and then on **Run anyway**.

#. Accept the UAC_ prompt.
#. Go through the various installation steps.

Odoo will automatically be started at the end of the installation.

Linux

Prepare
~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Debian/Ubuntu

      Odoo needs a `PostgreSQL`_ server to run properly. The default configuration for
      the Odoo 'deb' package is to use the PostgreSQL server on the same host as your
      Odoo instance. Execute the following command in order to install the PostgreSQL server:

      .. code-block:: console

         $ sudo apt install postgresql -y

   .. group-tab:: Fedora

      Odoo needs a `PostgreSQL`_ server to run properly. Make sure that the `sudo` command is
      available and well configured and, only then, execute the following command in order to
      install the PostgreSQL server:

      .. code-block:: console

         $ sudo dnf install -y postgresql-server
         $ sudo postgresql-setup --initdb --unit postgresql
         $ sudo systemctl enable postgresql
         $ sudo systemctl start postgresql

.. warning::
   `wkhtmltopdf` is not installed through **pip** and must be installed manually in version `0.12.5
   <the wkhtmltopdf download page_>`_ for it to support headers and footers. See our `wiki
   <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/wiki/Wkhtmltopdf>`_ for more details on the various versions.

Repository
~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Debian/Ubuntu

      Odoo S.A. provides a repository that can be used with Debian and Ubuntu distributions. It can
      be used to install *Odoo Community Edition* by executing the following commands:

      .. code-block:: console

          $ wget -q -O - https://nightly.odoo.com/odoo.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/odoo-archive-keyring.gpg
          $ echo 'deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/odoo-archive-keyring.gpg] https://nightly.odoo.com/{CURRENT_MAJOR_BRANCH}/nightly/deb/ ./' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/odoo.list
          $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install odoo

      You can then use the usual `apt-get upgrade` command to keep your installation up-to-date.

   .. group-tab:: Fedora

      Odoo S.A. provides a repository that can be used with the Fedora distributions. It can be used
      to install *Odoo Community Edition* by executing the following commands:

      .. code-block:: console

         $ sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo=https://nightly.odoo.com/{CURRENT_MAJOR_BRANCH}/nightly/rpm/odoo.repo
         $ sudo dnf install -y odoo
         $ sudo systemctl enable odoo
         $ sudo systemctl start odoo

.. note::
   At this moment, there is no nightly repository for the Enterprise Edition.

Distribution package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Debian/Ubuntu

      Instead of using the repository as described above, the 'deb' packages for both the
      *Community* and *Enterprise* editions can be downloaded from the `official download page
      <download_>`_.

      .. note::
         Odoo {CURRENT_MAJOR_VERSION} 'deb' package currently supports `Debian 11 (Bullseye)`_,
         `Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy)`_ or above.

      Next, execute the following commands **as root**:

      .. code-block:: console

         # dpkg -i <path_to_installation_package> # this probably fails with missing dependencies
         # apt-get install -f # should install the missing dependencies
         # dpkg -i <path_to_installation_package>

      This will install Odoo as a service, create the necessary PostgreSQL_ user
      and automatically start the server.

      .. warning::
         - The `python3-xlwt` Debian package does not exists in Debian Buster nor Ubuntu 18.04. This
           python module is needed to export into xls format.

           If you need the feature, you can install it manually with:

           .. code-block:: console

              $ sudo pip3 install xlwt

         - The `num2words` python package does not exists in Debian Buster nor Ubuntu 18.04. Textual
           amounts will not be rendered by Odoo and this could cause problems with the `l10n_mx_edi`
           module.

           If you need this feature, you can install manually with:

           .. code-block:: console

              $ sudo pip3 install num2words

   .. group-tab:: Fedora

      Instead of using the repository as described above, the 'rpm' packages for both the
      *Community* and *Enterprise* editions can be downloaded from the `official download page
      <download_>`_.

      .. note::
         Odoo {CURRENT_MAJOR_VERSION} 'rpm' package supports Fedora 36.

      Once downloaded, the package can be installed using the 'dnf' package manager:

      .. code-block:: console

         $ sudo dnf localinstall odoo_{CURRENT_MAJOR_BRANCH}.latest.noarch.rpm
         $ sudo systemctl enable odoo
         $ sudo systemctl start odoo

.. _setup/install/source:

Source install
==============

The source "installation" is really about not installing Odoo, and running it directly from source
instead.

It can be more convenient for module developers as the Odoo source is more easily accessible than
using packaged installation.

It also makes starting and stopping Odoo more flexible and explicit than the services set up by the
packaged installations, and allows overriding settings using
:ref:`command-line parameters <reference/cmdline>` without needing to edit a configuration file.

Finally it provides greater control over the system's set up, and allows to more easily keep
(and run) multiple versions of Odoo side-by-side.

Fetch the sources
-----------------

There are two ways to obtain the source code of Odoo: as a zip **archive** or through **git**.

Archive
~~~~~~~

Community Edition:

* `Official download page <download_>`_
* `GitHub repository <community-repository_>`_
* `Nightly server <nightly_>`_

Enterprise Edition:

* `Official download page <download_>`_
* `GitHub repository <enterprise-repository_>`_

The following requires `Git <git_>`_ to be installed on your machine and that you have basic
knowledge of Git commands. To clone a Git repository, you must choose between cloning with HTTPS or
SSH. If you do not know the difference between the two, the best option is most likely HTTPS. If you
are following the :doc:`Getting started </developer/tutorials/getting_started>` developer tutorial,
or plan on contributing to Odoo source code, choose SSH.

   **The Enterprise git repository does not contain the full Odoo source code**. It is only a
   collection of extra add-ons. The main server code is in the Community version. Running the
   Enterprise version actually means running the server from the Community version with the
   addons-path option set to the folder with the Enterprise version. You need to clone both the
   Community and Enterprise repository to have a working Odoo Enterprise installation. See
   :ref:`setup/install/editions` to get access to the Enterprise repository.

Python
~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Windows

      Odoo requires Python 3.7 or later to run. Visit `Python's download page <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>`_
      to download and install the latest version of Python 3 on your machine.

      During installation, check **Add Python 3 to PATH**, then click **Customize Installation** and make
      sure that **pip** is checked.

      .. note::
         If Python 3 is already installed, make sure that the version is 3.7 or above, as previous
         versions are not compatible with Odoo.

         .. code-block:: doscon

PostgreSQL
~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Windows

      Odoo uses PostgreSQL as database management system. `Download and install PostgreSQL
      <https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/>`_ (supported version: 12.0 and later).

      By default, the only user is `postgres` but Odoo forbids connecting as `postgres`, so you need
      to create a new PostgreSQL user:

      #. Add PostgreSQL's `bin` directory (by default:
         :file:`C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\<version>\\bin`) to your `PATH`.
      #. Create a postgres user with a password using the pg admin gui:

         1. Open **pgAdmin**.
         2. Double-click the server to create a connection.
         3. Select :menuselection:`Object --> Create --> Login/Group Role`.
         4. Enter the username in the **Role Name** field (e.g. `odoo`).
         5. Open the **Definition** tab and enter the password (e.g. `odoo`), then click **Save**.
         6. Open the **Privileges** tab and switch **Can login?** to `Yes` and **Create database?**
            to `Yes`.

   .. group-tab:: Linux

      Odoo uses PostgreSQL as database management system. Use your package manager to download and
      install PostgreSQL (supported version: 12.0 and later).

      It can be achieved by executing the following:

      .. code-block:: console

          $ sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-client

      By default, the only user is `postgres` but Odoo forbids connecting as `postgres`, so you need
      to create a new PostgreSQL user:

      .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo -u postgres createuser -s $USER
        $ createdb $USER

      .. note::
         Because your PostgreSQL user has the same name as your Unix login, you will be able to
         connect to the database without password.

   .. group-tab:: Mac OS

      Odoo uses PostgreSQL as database management system. Use `postgres.app
      <https://postgresapp.com>`_ to download and install PostgreSQL (supported version: 12.0 and
      later).

      .. tip::
         To make the command line tools bundled with `postgres.app` available, make sure to setup your
         `$PATH` variable by following the `Postgres.app CLI Tools Instructions
         <https://postgresapp.com/documentation/cli-tools.html>`_.

      By default, the only user is `postgres` but Odoo forbids connecting as `postgres`, so you need
      to create a new PostgreSQL user:

      .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo -u postgres createuser -s $USER
        $ createdb $USER

      .. note::
         Because your PostgreSQL user has the same name as your Unix login, you will be able to
         connect to the database without password.

.. _install/dependencies:

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Windows

      Before installing the dependencies, you must download and install the `Build Tools for Visual
      Studio <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019>`_.
      When prompted, select **C++ build tools** in the **Workloads** tab and install them.

      Odoo dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file located at the root of the Odoo
      community directory.

      .. tip::
         It can be preferable to not mix python modules packages between different instances of Odoo
         or with your system. You can use virtualenv_ to create isolated Python environments.

      Navigate to the path of your Odoo Community installation (`CommunityPath`) and run **pip** on
      the requirements file in a terminal **with Administrator privileges**:

      .. code-block:: doscon

          C:\> cd \CommunityPath
          C:\> pip install setuptools wheel
          C:\> pip install -r requirements.txt

      For languages with right-to-left interface (such as Arabic or Hebrew), the package `rtlcss`
      is needed:

      #. Download and install `nodejs <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>`_.
      #. Install `rtlcss`:

         .. code-block:: doscon

             C:\> npm install -g rtlcss

      #. Edit the System Environment's variable `PATH` to add the folder where `rtlcss.cmd` is
         located (typically: :file:`C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\`).

   .. group-tab:: Linux

      Using your **distribution packages** is the preferred way of installing dependencies.
      Alternatively, you can install the python dependencies with **pip**.

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Debian/Ubuntu

            For Debian-based systems, the packages are listed in the `debian/control
            <{GITHUB_PATH}/debian/control>`_ file of the Odoo sources.

            On Debian/Ubuntu, the following commands should install the required packages:

            .. code-block:: console

               $ cd /CommunityPath
               $ sed -n -e '/^Depends:/,/^Pre/ s/ python3-\(.*\),/python3-\1/p' debian/control | sudo xargs apt-get install -y

         .. tab:: Install with pip

            As some of the python packages need a compilation step, they require system libraries to
            be installed.

            On Debian/Ubuntu-based systems, the following command should install these required
            libraries:

            .. code-block:: console

               $ sudo apt install python3-pip libldap2-dev libpq-dev libsasl2-dev

            Odoo dependencies are listed in the :file:`requirements.txt` file located at the root of
            the Odoo community directory.

            .. note::
               | The python packages in :file:`requirements.txt` are based on their stable/LTS
                 Debian/Ubuntu corresponding version at the moment of the Odoo release.
               | E.g., for Odoo 15.0, the `python3-babel` package version is 2.8.0 in Debian
                 Bullseye and 2.6.0 in Ubuntu Focal. The lowest version is then chosen in the
                 :file:`requirements.txt`.

            .. tip::
               It can be preferable to not mix python modules packages between different instances
               of Odoo or with your system. You can use virtualenv_ to create isolated Python
               environments.

            Navigate to the path of your Odoo Community installation (:file:`CommunityPath`) and run
            **pip** on the requirements file to install the requirements for the current user.

            .. code-block:: console

.. _setup/install/source/running_odoo:

Running Odoo
------------

Once all dependencies are set up, Odoo can be launched by running `odoo-bin`, the
command-line interface of the server. It is located at the root of the Odoo Community directory.

To configure the server, you can either specify :ref:`command-line arguments
<reference/cmdline/server>` or a :ref:`configuration file <reference/cmdline/config>`.

.. tip::
   For the Enterprise edition, you must add the path to the `enterprise` addons to the `addons-path`
   argument. Note that it must come before the other paths in `addons-path` for addons to be loaded
   correctly.

Common necessary configurations are:

- PostgreSQL user and password.
- Custom addon paths beyond the defaults, to load your own modules.

A typical way to run the server would be:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Windows

      .. code-block:: doscon

          C:\> cd CommunityPath/
          C:\> python odoo-bin -r dbuser -w dbpassword --addons-path=addons -d mydb

      Where `CommunityPath` is the path of the Odoo Community installation, `dbuser` is the
      PostgreSQL login, `dbpassword` is the PostgreSQL password, and `mydb` is the name of the
      PostgreSQL database.

   .. group-tab:: Linux

      .. code-block:: console

          $ cd /CommunityPath
          $ python3 odoo-bin --addons-path=addons -d mydb

      Where `CommunityPath` is the path of the Odoo Community installation, and `mydb` is the name
      of the PostgreSQL database.

   .. group-tab:: Mac OS

      .. code-block:: console

          $ cd /CommunityPath
          $ python3 odoo-bin --addons-path=addons -d mydb

      Where `CommunityPath` is the path of the Odoo Community installation, and `mydb` is the name
      of the PostgreSQL database.

After the server has started (the INFO log `odoo.modules.loading: Modules loaded.` is printed), open
http://localhost:8069 in your web browser and log in with the base administrator account: Use
`admin` for the :guilabel:`Email` and, again, `admin` for the :guilabel:`Password`. That's it, you
just logged into your own Odoo database!

.. tip::
