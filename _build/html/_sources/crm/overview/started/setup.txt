=======================================================

This quick step-by-step guide will lead you through Odoo CRM and help
you handle your sales funnel easily and constantly manage your sales
funnel from lead to customer.

Configuration
=============

Create your database from `www.odoo.com/start <http://www.odoo.com/start>`__, select the CRM

.. tip::

        You will notice that the installation of the CRM module has created the
        submodules Chat, Calendar and Contacts. They are mandatory so that every
        feature of the app is running smoothly.

Introduction to the Sales Planner
=================================

The Sales Planner is a useful step-by-step guide created to help you
implement your sales funnel and define your sales objectives easier. We
strongly recommend you to go through every step of the tool the first
time you use Odoo CRM and to follow the requirements. Your input are
strictly personal and intended as a personal guide and mentor into your
work. As it does not interact with the backend, you are free to adapt
any detail whenever you feel it is needed.

You can reach the Sales Planner from anywhere within the CRM module by
clicking on the progress bar located on the upper-right side of your
screen. It will show you how far you are in the use of the Sales
Planner.

Set up your first sales team
============================

Create a new team
-----------------

A Direct Sales team is created by default on your instance. You can
either use it or create a new one. Refer to the page :doc:`../../salesteam/setup/create_team`
for more information.

Assign salespeople to your sales team
-------------------------------------

When your sales teams are created, the next step is to link your
salespeople to their team so they will be able to work on the
opportunities they are supposed to receive. For example, if within your
company Tim is selling products and John is selling maintenance
contracts, they will be assigned to different teams and will only
receive opportunities that make sense to them.

In Odoo CRM, you can create a new user on the fly and assign it directly
to a sales team. From the **Dashboard**, click on the button **More** of
your selected sales team, then on **Settings**. Then, under the
**Assignation** section, click on **Create** to add a new salesperson to
the team.

From the **Create: salesman** pop up window (see screenshot below),
you can assign someone on your team:

- Either your salesperson already exists in the system and you will
  just need to click on it from the drop-down list and it will be
  assigned to the team
- Or you want to assign a new salesperson that doesn't exist into the
  system yet - you can do it by creating a new user on the fly from
  the sales team. Just enter the name of your new salesperson and
  click on Create (see below) to create a new user into the system
  and directly assign it to your team. The new user will receive an
  invite email to set his password and log into the system. Refer
  to :doc:`../../salesteam/manage/create_salesperson`
  for more information about that process

Set up your pipeline
--------------------

Now that your sales team is created and your salespeople are linked to
it, you will need to set up your pipeline -create the process by which
your team will generate, qualify and close opportunities through your
sales cycle. Refer to the document :doc:`../../salesteam/setup/organize_pipeline`
to define the stages of your pipeline.

Set up incoming email to generate opportunities
-----------------------------------------------

In Odoo CRM, one way to generate opportunities into your sales team is
to create a generic email address as a trigger. For example, if the
personal email address of your Direct team is
`direct@mycompany.example.com <mailto:direct@mycompany.example.com>`__\, 
every email sent will automatically create a new opportunity into the
sales team.

Refer to the page :doc:`../../leads/generate/emails` to set it up.

Automate lead assignation
-------------------------

If your company generates a high volume of leads every day, it could
be useful to automate the assignation so the system will distribute
all your opportunities automatically to the right department.

Refer to the document :doc:`../../leads/manage/automatic_assignation` for more information.
