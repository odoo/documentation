Subscription reports
====================

.. |MRR| replace:: :abbr:`MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)`
.. |ARR| replace:: :abbr:`ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)`

The Odoo **Subscriptions** app provides a series of reporting pages to help companies analyze how
subscriptions are performing.

On the *Subscriptions Analysis* reporting page, users can view specific data related to recurring
subscriptions, quantity of subscriptions, in-progress or paused subscriptions, and more.

The *Retention Analysis* reporting page provides an organized table of subscription retention
percentages over any period of time.

The *MRR Breakdown* reporting page clearly divides |MRR| and |ARR| metrics for subscriptions into
various graphs, lists, and charts.

And the *MRR Analysis* reporting page offers a time-based collection of analytics showcasing how
subscription |MRR| and |ARR| have changed over the course of any given period of time.

Reporting page elements
=======================

All subscriptions-based reporting pages can be accessed via the :guilabel:`Reporting` header menu in
the **Subscriptions** app.

The following sections describe elements found on each reporting page.

Filters and Group By
--------------------

*Filters* are used to narrow down metrics to show specific analytics, whereas groupings (via the
*Group By* option) are used to gather the data from specific sections into groups for more
organized analysis.

This section refers to both filters and groupings, as a combination of the two can be saved in the
*Favorites* section.

To modify the results being shown on any reporting page, click the :icon:`fa-caret-down`
:guilabel:`(down arrow)` icon to the right of the search bar. Doing so reveals a drop-down menu of
detailed filter and grouping options.

If desired, a filter or grouping (or combination of filters and/or groupings) can be saved in the
:guilabel:`Favorites` section of that drop-down menu. To do so, click the :icon:`fa-caret-down`
:guilabel:`(down arrow)` icon beside :guilabel:`Save current search`, located beneath the
:guilabel:`Favorites` section.

This reveals a field to assign a title to the favorite filter. Two options are also found beneath
the title field: :guilabel:`Default filter` and :guilabel:`Shared`.

Ticking the checkbox beside :guilabel:`Default filter` makes the newly-favorited filter the default
option for that reporting page.

Ticking the checkbox beside :guilabel:`Shared` makes the newly-favorited filter available to other
users in the database.

.. note::
   The :guilabel:`Default filter` and :guilabel:`Shared` options are **not** required, and only
   *one* of these options can be selected at a time.

To save the filter, click :guilabel:`Save` in the :guilabel:`Favorites` section of the drop-down
filter menu.

When clicked, that saved filter appears beneath the :guilabel:`Favorites` column of the drop-down
filter menu, and a :icon:`fa-star` :guilabel:`(gold star)` icon appears beside the favorite filter's
name in the search bar.

Views
-----

On the :guilabel:`Subscription Analysis`, :guilabel:`MRR Breakdown`, and :guilabel:`MRR Analysis`
reporting pages, three different view options are located in the upper-right corner.
