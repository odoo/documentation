How to accept credit card payments in Odoo POS using Mercury?
=============================================================

Overview
========

A **MercuryPay** account (see `MercuryPay website <https://www.mercurypay.com>`__.) 
is required to accept credit
card payments in Odoo 9 POS with an integrated card reader. MercuryPay
only operates with US and Canadian banks making this procedure only
suitable for North American businesses. An alternative to an integrated
card reader is to work with a standalone card reader, copy the
transaction total from the Odoo POS screen into the card reader, and
record the transaction in Odoo POS.

Module installation
===================

Go to **Apps** and install the **Mercury Payment Services** application.
