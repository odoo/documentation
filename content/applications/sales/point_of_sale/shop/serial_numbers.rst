Serial numbers and lots
=======================

Working with **serial numbers** and **lots** allows tracking your products' movements. When products
are tracked, the system identifies their location based on their last movement.

To enable traceability, go to :menuselection:`Point of Sale --> Products --> Products`. Then,
select a product and check the :guilabel:`Tracking By Unique Serial Number` or the
:guilabel:`Tracking By Lots` box in the :guilabel:`Inventory` tab.

Serial numbers and lots importation
===================================

You can import serial numbers in Point of Sale. To do so, select a **sales order** or a
**quotation** containing tracked products. Then, agree to load the **Lots or Serial Numbers** linked
to the :abbr:`SO (sales order)`.

The imported tracking numbers appear below the tracked products. You can modify them by clicking on
the list-view button next to the products.

Serial numbers and lots creation
================================

If a tracked product is available in your POS, adding the product to the cart opens a pop-up window
where you can type or scan the product's serial or lot numbers. To add more than one of the same
tracked products, click on **enter** to validate and start a new line.

.. note::
   - Changing a tracked product's quantity using the numpad turns the list-view button red. Click on
     it to add the missing lot and serial numbers.
   - :guilabel:`Lot & Serial Number(s)` are :guilabel:`required` on tracked products but not
     mandatory. Meaning that not attributing some or any does **not** prevent from completing the
     sale.
   - there are thirdparty apps in the Odoo App Store, which can link your stock from inventory module to your PoS (e.g. selling a product in PoS reduces the stock of this product in your inventory.). For now selling products in PoS does not reduce your Odoo inventory stock. You can only find the PoS movements in the product form under the smartbutton "Units Sold" and it influences the "forecasted" amount like this: I sell 13 products in the PoS and I have 2 on stock --> forecasted units = -11
