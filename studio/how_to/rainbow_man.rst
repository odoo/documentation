Customizing the Rainbow Man
===========================

The Rainbow Man in Odoo is an animation shown once the user completes certain tasks and clicks on
certain buttons. It is a way to make the software fun to use, and rewarding, for employees.

| On most buttons in Odoo, such as *Send by Email*, *Confirm* or *Cancel*, once they are selected in
  Studio, under their *Properties*, the *Rainbow Man* effect can be applied.
| By default, the feature is active:

- when opportunities are marked as won;
- when users empty their inboxes;
- when the user finishes a tour;
- when the user finishes doing reconciliations.
