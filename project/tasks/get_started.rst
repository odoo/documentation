======================
Get Started with Tasks
======================

Break down a project by creating, assigning and organizing tasks. Set priorities to help you
determine where you want to invest your time first, manage files within it and keep everything you
need to complete your work in one place. Ensure that your strategies are turned into actionable
plans and, as a result, have a successful project.

Create a task

Sort tasks by priority
======================

| Mark the star on your task to set it as a high priority one. That automatically moves the task
  to the top of the column. Tasks that are not starred are classified according to their
  deadlines.
| Note that tasks with dates passed their deadlines are shown in red; tasks with a deadline for
  the current date are orange.
