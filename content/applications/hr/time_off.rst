Time off
========

Odoo's **Time Off** application serves as a centralized hub for all time-off-related information.
This application manages requests, balances, allocations, approvals, and reports.

Users can :doc:`request time off <../hr/time_off/request_time_off>`, and see an overview of their
requests and time off balances. Managers can :doc:`allocate time off <time_off/allocations>` to
individuals, teams, or the whole company, and :ref:`approve time off requests
<time_off/manage-time-off>`.

Detailed :doc:`reports <time_off/reporting>` can be run to see how much time off (and what kinds of
time off) are being used, :doc:`accrual plans <time_off/accrual_plans>` can be created, and
:doc:`public holidays <time_off/public_holidays>` can be set.

.. note::
   Be advised, only users with specific access rights can see all aspects of the **Time Off** app.

   All users can access the *My Time Off* and *Overview* sections of the **Time Off** app. All other
   sections require specific access rights.

   To better understand how access rights affect the **Time Off** app, refer to the
   :doc:`employees/new_employee` document, specifically the section about configuring the *Work
   Information* tab.

   :doc:`../general/users/access_rights`

Configuration
=============

In order to allocate time off to employees, and for employees to request and use their time off, the
various :doc:`time off types must be configured <time_off/time_off_types>` first, then
:doc:`allocated <time_off/allocations>` to employees (if allocation is required).

Mandatory days
--------------

Some companies have special days where specific departments, or the entire staff, is required to be
present, and time off is not allowed on those specific days.

These types of days are called *mandatory days* in Odoo. These can be configured to be company-wide,
or department specific. When configured, employees in the specified department or company are unable
to submit time off requests for these mandatory days.

Create mandatory days
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No mandatory days are configured in Odoo by default. To create a mandatory day, navigate to
:menuselection:`Time Off app --> Configuration --> Mandatory Days`.

Click the :guilabel:`New` button in the top-left corner, and a blank line appears in the list.

Enter the following information on that new line:

- :guilabel:`Name`: Enter the name of the mandatory day.
- :guilabel:`Company`: If in a multi-company database, this field is visible, and the current
  company populates this field, by default. Using the drop-down menu, select the company the
  mandatory day is for.
- :guilabel:`Departments`: This column is hidden by default. First, click the
  :icon:`oi-settings-adjust` :guilabel:`(additional options)` icon in the top-right corner, next to
  :guilabel:`Color`, and then tick the checkbox next to :guilabel:`Departments` to reveal that
  column.

  Next, select the desired departments from the drop-down menu. Multiple departments can be
  selected, and there is no limit to the amount of departments that can be added.

  If this field is left blank, the mandatory day applies to the entire company.
- :guilabel:`Start Date`: Using the calendar picker, select the date the mandatory day starts.
- :guilabel:`End Date`: Using the calendar picker, select the date the mandatory day ends. If
  creating a single mandatory day, the end date should be the same as the start date.
- :guilabel:`Color`: If desired, select a color from the available presented options. If no color is
  desired, select the `No color` option, represented by a white box with. The selected color appears
  on the main **Time Off** app dashboard, in both the calendar and in the legend.

Overview
========

To view a color-coded schedule of the user's time off, and/or of the team managed by them, navigate
to :menuselection:`Time Off app --> Overview`. This presents a calendar with the default filter of
`My Team`, in a quarterly (three month) view.

To change the time period displayed, click on the :icon:`fa-calendar` :guilabel:`(time period)`
button to reveal a drop-down menu. Then, select either :guilabel:`Today`, :guilabel:`This week`,
:guilabel:`This month`, :guilabel:`This year`, or a custom time period, to present the calendar in
that corresponding view.

To navigate forward or backward in time, in the selected increment (:guilabel:`Month`,
:guilabel:`Week`, etc.), click the :icon:`oi-arrow-left` :guilabel:`(left arrow)` or
:icon:`oi-arrow-right` :guilabel:`(right arrow)` buttons to move either forward or backward in that
specified amount of time. For example, if :guilabel:`Month` is selected, the arrows adjust the view
by one month.

To return to a view containing the current day, click the :icon:`fa-crosshairs` :guilabel:`(Focus
Today)` button at any time.

Team members are listed alphabetically on individual lines, and their requested time off, regardless
of the status (*validated* or *to approve*), is visible on the calendar.

Each employee is color-coded. The employee's color is selected at random, and does *not* correspond
to the type of time off they requested.

The status of the time off is represented by the color detail of the request, either appearing solid
(*validated*) or striped (*to approve*).

The number of days or hours requested is written on the request (if there is enough space).

At the bottom of the calendar, in the :guilabel:`Total` line, a bar graph shows how many people are
projected to be out on any given day. The number on each individual bar represents the number of
employees out for those highlighted days.

Click on a time off entry to view the details for the specific time off entry. The total number of
hours or days are listed, along with the start and end time of the time off. To view the details of
the time off request in a modal, click the :guilabel:`View` button.
