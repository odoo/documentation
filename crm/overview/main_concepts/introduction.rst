Hi, my name is Nicholas, I'm a business manager in the textile industry. I sell accessories to retailers. Do you know the difference between a good salesperson and an excellent salesperson? The key is to be productive and organized to do the job. That's where Odoo comes in. Thanks to a well structured organization you'll change a good team into an exceptional team. 

With Odoo CRM, the job is much easier for me and my entire team. When I log in into Odoo CRM, I have a direct overview of my ongoing performance. But also the activity of the next 7 days and the performance of the last month. I see that I overachieved last month when compared to my invoicing target of $200,000. I have a structured approach of my performance. 

If I want to have a deeper look into the details, I click on next actions and I can see that today I have planned a call with Think Big Systems. Once I have done my daily review, I usually go to my pipeline. The process is the same for everyone in the team. Our job is to find resellers and before closing any deal we have to go through different stages. We usually have a first contact to qualify the opportunity, then move into offer & negotiation stage, and closing by a 'won'..Well, that's if all goes well.
The user interface is really smooth, I can drag and drop any business opportunity from one stage to another in just a few clicks. 

Now I'd like to go further with an interesting contact: a department store. I highlighted their file by changing the color. For each contact, I have a form view where I can access to all necessary information about the contact. I see here my opportunity Macy's has an estimated revenue of $50,000 and a success rate of 10%. I need to discuss about this partnership, so I will schedule a meeting straight from the contact form: Macy's partnership meeting. It's super easy to create a new meeting with any contact. I can as well send an email straight from the opportunity form and the answer from the prospect will simply pop up in the system too. Now, let's assume that the meeting took place, therefore I can mark it as done. And the system automatically suggests a next activity. Actually, we configured Odoo with a set of typical activities we follow for every opportunity, and it's great to have a thorough followup. The next activity will be a follow-up email. Browsing from one screen to the other is really simple and adapting to the view too! I can see my opportunitities as a to-do list of next activities for example.

With Odoo CRM I have a sales management tool that is really efficient and me and my team can be well organized. I have a clear overview of my sales pipeline, meetings, revenues, and more.

I go back to my pipeline. Macy's got qualified successfully, which mean I can move their file to the next step and I will adapt the expected revenue as discussed. Once I have performed the qualification process, I will create a new quotation based on the feedback I received from my contact. For my existing customers, I can as well quickly discover the activity around them for any Odoo module I use, and continue to discuss about them. It's that simple.

We have seen how I can manage my daily job as business manager or salesperson. At the end of the journey I would like to have a concrete view of my customer relationships and expected revenues. If I go into the reports in Odoo CRM, I have the possibility to know exactly what's the evolution of the leads over the past months, or have a look at the potential revenues and the performance of the different teams in terms of conversions from leads to opportunities for instance. So with Odoo I can have a clear reporting of every activity based on predefined metrics or favorites. I can search for other filters too and adapt the view. If I want to go in the details, I choose the list view and can click on any item

Odoo CRM is not only a powerful tool to achieve our sales goals with structured activities, performance dashboard, next acitivities and more, but also allows me to:
Use leads to get in the system unqualified but targeted contacts I may have gathered in a conference or through a contact form on my website. Those leads can then be converted into opportunities.
Manage phone calls from Odoo CRM by using the VoIP app. Call customers, manage a call queue, log calls, schedule calls and next actions to perform.
Integrate with Odoo Sales to create beautiful online or PDF quotations and turn them into sales orders.
Use email marketing for marketing campaigns to my customers and prospects.
Manage my business seamlessly, even on the go. Indeed, Odoo offers a mobile app that lets every business organize key sales activities from leads to quotes.

Odoo CRM is a powerful, yet easy-to-use app. I firstly used the sales planner to clearly state my objectives and set up our CRM. It will help you getting started quickly too.
