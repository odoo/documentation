How to manage invoices & payment in multiple currencies?
========================================================

Overview
========

Odoo provides multi-currency support with automatic currency gross or
loss entry adjustment. There are a few things Odoo has been to ease the
user's life.

All the account transactions will be done using the company currency.
However you can see two extra fields with the journal entry where
secondary currency and amount will visible. You can create
multi-currency journals of force a specific currency.

When creating an invoice, the currency can be changed very easily;
however Odoo takes the company currency as a default assignment. It will
convert all the amounts automatically using that currency.

Configuration
=============

Enable Multi-Currency
---------------------

For information about enabling Multi-Currency, please read the document:

In order to register payments in other currencies, you have to remove
the currency constraint on the journal. Go to the accounting
application, on the journal, click on :menuselection:`More --> Settings`.

Check if the currency field is empty or in the foreign currency in which
you will register the payments. If a currency is filled in, it means
that you can register payments only in this currency.

When reconciling it, Odoo will directly match the payment with the right
invoice. You will get the invoice price in the invoice currency and the
amount in your company currency.
