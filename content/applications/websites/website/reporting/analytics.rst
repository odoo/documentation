Website analytics
=================

Website analytics helps website owners monitor how people use their site. It provides data on
visitor demographics, behavior, and interactions, helping improve websites and marketing strategies.

You can track your Odoo website's traffic using :ref:`analytics/plausible` or
:ref:`analytics/google-analytics`. We recommend using Plausible.io as it is privacy-friendly,
lightweight, and easy to use.

The Plausible Analytics dashboard is also integrated into Odoo and can be accessed
via :menuselection:`Website --> Reporting --> Analytics`.

.. _analytics/plausible:

Plausible.io
============

Odoo hosts its own Plausible.io server and provides a free and ready-to-use Plausible.io
solution for **Odoo Online** databases that use the odoo.com domain. Odoo automatically creates and sets up
your account. Start using it by going to :menuselection:`Website --> Reporting --> Analytics`.

.. note::
   - If you use a custom :doc:`domain name <../configuration/domain_names>` (e.g., `example.com`), you need to
     create your own Plausible.io account and subscription.
   - **If you already have a Plausible.io account** and you want to connect it to your Odoo Online
     database, you must create two `ir.config.parameters` to use Plausible.io's servers. To do so,
     enable the :ref:`developer mode <developer-mode>` and go to :menuselection:`General Settings -->
     Technical --> System Parameters`. Click :guilabel:`New` and fill in the following :guilabel:`Key`
     and :guilabel:`Value` fields:

     .. list-table::
        :header-rows: 1

        * - Key
          - Value
        * - `website.plausible_script`
          - `https://plausible.io/js/plausible.js`
        * - `website.plausible_server`
          - `https://plausible.io`

   Then, follow the steps below to connect your existing account with Plausible.io servers.

If your database is hosted on **Odoo.sh** or **On-premise**, or if you wish to use your own
Plausible.io account, proceed as follows:

#. Create or sign in to a Plausible.io account using the following link: `<https://plausible.io/register>`_.
#. If you are creating a new account, go through the registration and activation steps. On the :guilabel:`Add website
   info` page, add the :guilabel:`Domain` of your website without including `www` (e.g.,
   `example.odoo.com`) and change the :guilabel:`Reporting Timezone`, if necessary. Click
   :guilabel:`Install Plausible` to proceed to the next step. Ignore the :guilabel:`Manual installation`
   instructions and click :guilabel:`Start collecting data`.
#. Once done, click the Plausible.io logo in the upper-left part of the page to access your `list of
   websites <https://plausible.io/sites>`_, then click the :icon:`fa-ellipsis-v` (:guilabel:`ellipsis`) icon next to the
   website and select :icon:`fa-cog` :guilabel:`Settings` from the drop-down menu.

   .. image:: analytics/plausible-gear-icon-settings.png
      :alt: Click the gear icon in the list of websites.

#. In the sidebar, select :guilabel:`Visibility`, then click :guilabel:`Add Shared link`.
#. Enter a :guilabel:`Name`, leave the :guilabel:`Password (optional)` field empty, as the Plausible analytics
   dashboard integration in Odoo does not support it, then click :guilabel:`Create shared link`.

#. Copy the shared link.

   .. image:: analytics/plausible-copy-shared-link.png
      :alt: Copy the shared link URL from Plausible.io

#. In Odoo, go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings`.
#. In the :guilabel:`SEO` section, enable :guilabel:`Plausible Analytics`, then paste the
   :guilabel:`Shared Link Auth` and click :guilabel:`Save`.

.. tip::
   If you have :doc:`multiple websites <../configuration/multi_website>`, add your websites to your
   Plausible.io account by going to `<https://plausible.io/sites>`_ and clicking :guilabel:`+ Add
   Website`. In Odoo, in the **Website settings**, make sure to select the website in the
   :guilabel:`Settings of Website` field at the top of the page before pasting the :guilabel:`Shared link`.

.. note::
   Odoo automatically pushes two custom goals: `Lead Generation` and `Shop`.

#. Create or sign in to a Google account using the following link: `<https://analytics.google.com>`_.

.. _analytics/google-tag-manager:

Google Tag Manager
==================

Google Tag Manager is a tag management system that allows you to easily update
measurement codes and related code fragments, collectively known as tags on your website or mobile
app, directly through the code injector.

.. note::
   :abbr:`GTM (Google Tag Manager)` is not an analytics tool and does not offer reporting features;
   it is used to collect data and works alongside Google Analytics to provide more detailed insights.
   In order to use GTM properly, it is recommended to configure Google Analytics as well.

   For more information refer to the `documentation on linking Google Analytics and
   Google Tag Manager <https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/9442095?hl=en>`_.

.. warning::
   - Some GTM tags use data layers (e.g., advanced eCommerce tracking data layers) to retrieve
     variables and send them to Google Analytics. Data layers are currently not managed in Odoo.
   - Google Tag Manager may not be compliant with local data protection regulations.

To configure GTM, proceed as follows:

#. Create or sign in to a Google account by going to https://tagmanager.google.com/.

#. In the :guilabel:`Accounts` tab, click :guilabel:`Create Account`.

#. Enter an :guilabel:`Account Name` and select the account's :guilabel:`Country`.

#. Enter your website's URL in the :guilabel:`Container name` field and select the :guilabel:`Target
   platform`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Create` and agree to the Terms of Service.

#. Copy the `<head>` and `<body>` codes from the popup window. Then, go to your website, click
   :guilabel:`Edit`, go to the :guilabel:`Theme` tab, scroll down to the
   :guilabel:`Advanced` section, then click :guilabel:`<head>` and :guilabel:`</body>` next to
   :guilabel:`Code Injection` to paste the codes.

.. note::
   The data is collected in the marketing tools used to monitor the website (e.g., Google Analytics,
   Plausible, Facebook Pixel), not in Odoo.
