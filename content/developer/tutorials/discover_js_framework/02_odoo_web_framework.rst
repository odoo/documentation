Chapter 2: Odoo web framework
=============================

In the previous chapter, we learned to use Owl framework and its different concepts. We can now
learn how to use the Odoo JavaScript framework which is built on top of Owl.

   This is the progress that we have made in discovering the JavaScript web framework at the end of
   :doc:`01_components`.

In the `awesome_tshirt` module, we will build our Awesome dashboard. This will be a good
opportunity to discover many useful features in the Odoo JavaScript framework.

.. spoiler:: Solutions

   The solutions for each exercise of the chapter are hosted on the `official Odoo tutorials
   repository <https://github.com/odoo/tutorials/commits/{BRANCH}-solutions/awesome_tshirt>`_.

1. A new Layout
===============

Most screens in the Odoo web client uses a common layout: a control panel on top, with some buttons,
and a main content zone just below. This is done using a `Layout component
<{GITHUB_PATH}/addons/web/static/src/search/layout.js>`_, available in `@web/search/layout`.

.. exercise::

   Update the `AwesomeDashboard` component located in :file:`awesome_tshirt/static/src/` to use the
   `Layout` component. You can use :code:`{ "top-right": false, "bottom-right": false }` for the
   `display` props of the `Layout` component.

   - `Example: use of Layout in kanban view
     <{GITHUB_PATH}/addons/web/static/src/views/kanban/kanban_controller.xml>`_

2. Add some buttons for quick navigation
========================================

Bafien Carpink want buttons for easy access to common views in Odoo. In order to do that, you will
need to use the action service.

:ref:`Services <frontend/services>` is a notion defined by the Odoo JavaScript framework, it is a
persistent piece of code that exports state and/or functions. Each service can depend on other
services, and components can import a service with the `useService()` hooks.

.. example::

   This shows how to open the settings view from a component using the action service.

   .. code-block:: js

      import { useService } from "@web/core/utils/hooks";
      ...
      setup() {
          this.action = useService("action");
      }
      openSettings() {
          this.action.doAction("base_setup.action_general_configuration");
      }
      ...

.. exercise::

   Let us add three buttons in the control panel bottom left zone.

   #. A button `Customers`, which opens a kanban view with all customers (this action already
      exists, so you should use `its xml id
      <{GITHUB_PATH}/odoo/addons/base/views/res_partner_views.xml#L513>`_).
   #. A button `New Orders`, which opens a list view with all orders created in the last 7 days.
   #. A button `Cancelled Order`, which opens a list of all orders created in the last 7 days, but
      already cancelled.

     /journal_dashboard_activity.js#L35>`_
   - `Code: action service
     <{GITHUB_PATH}/addons/web/static/src/webclient/actions/action_service.js>`_

3. Call the server, add some statistics
=======================================

Let's improve the dashboard by adding a few cards (see the `Card` component made in the Owl
training) containing a few statistics. There is a route `/awesome_tshirt/statistics` that will
perform some computations and return an object containing some useful information.

Whenever we need to call a specific controller, we need to use the :ref:`rpc service
<frontend/services/rpc>`. It only exports a single function that perform the request:
:code:`rpc(route, params, settings)`

Here is a short explanation on the various arguments:

- `route` is the target route, as a string. For example `/myroute/`.
- `params` is an object that contains all data that will be given to the controller. (optional)
- `settings` are for advanced controls on the request. Make it silent, or using a specific xhr
  instance. (optional)

.. example::

   A basic request could look like this:

   .. code-block:: js

      setup() {
          this.rpc = useService("rpc");
          onWillStart(async () => {
              const result = await this.rpc("/my/controller", {a: 1, b: 2});
              // ...
          });
      }

.. exercise::
   #. Change `Dashboard` so that it uses the `rpc` service.
   #. Call the statistics route `/awesome_tshirt/statistics` in the `onWillStart` hook.
   #. Display a few cards in the dashboard containing:

      - Number of new orders this month
      - Total amount of new orders this month
      - Average amount of t-shirt by order this month
      - Number of cancelled orders this month
      - Average time for an order to go from 'new' to 'sent' or 'cancelled'

   - `Code: rpc service <{GITHUB_PATH}/addons/web/static/src/core/network/rpc_service.js>`_
   - `Example: calling a route in onWillStart
     <{GITHUB_PATH}/addons/lunch/static/src/views/search_model.js#L21>`_

4. Cache network calls, create a service
========================================

If you open your browser dev tools, in the network tabs, you will probably see that the call to
`/awesome_tshirt/statistics` is done every time the client action is displayed. This is because the
`onWillStart` hook is called each time the `Dashboard` component is mounted. But in this case, we
would probably prefer to do it only the first time, so we actually need to maintain some state
outside of the `Dashboard` component. This is a nice use case for a service!

.. example::

   The following example registers a simple service that displays a notification every 5 seconds.

   .. code-block:: js

      import { registry } from "@web/core/registry";
      const myService = {
          dependencies: ["notification"],
          start(env, { notification }) {
              let counter = 1;
              setInterval(() => {
                  notification.add(`Tick Tock ${counter++}`);
              }, 5000);
          },
      };
      registry.category("services").add("myService", myService);

.. exercise::

   #. Implements a new `awesome_tshirt.statistics` service.
   #. It should provide a function `loadStatistics` that, once called, performs the actual rpc, and
      always return the same information.
   #. Maybe use the `memoize
      <{GITHUB_PATH}/addons/web/static/src/core/utils/functions.js#L11>`_ utility function from
      `@web/core/utils/functions`
   #. Use this service in the `Dashboard` component.
   #. Check that it works as expected

   - `Example: service with a dependency
     <{GITHUB_PATH}/addons/web/static/src/core/user_service.js>`_

5. Display a pie chart
======================

Everyone likes charts (!), so let us add a pie chart in our dashboard, which displays the
proportions of t-shirts sold for each size: S/M/L/XL/XXL.

For this exercise, we will use `Chart.js <https://www.chartjs.org/>`_. It is the chart library used
by the graph view. However, it is not loaded by default, so we will need to either add it to our
assets bundle, or lazy load it (it's usually better since our users will not have to load the
chartjs code every time if they don't need it).

.. exercise::
   #. Load chartjs, you can use the `loadJs
      <{GITHUB_PATH}/addons/web/static/src/core/assets.js#L23>`_ function to load
      :file:`/web/static/lib/Chart/Chart.js`.
   #. In a `Card` (from previous exercises), display a `pie chart
      <https://www.chartjs.org/docs/2.8.0/charts/doughnut.html>`_ in the dashboard that displays the
      correct quantity for each sold t-shirts in each size (that information is available in the
      statistics route).

6. Going further
================

Here is a list of some small improvements you could try to do if you have the time:

.. exercise::

   #. Make sure your application can be :ref:`translated <reference/translations>` (with
      `env._t`).
   #. Clicking on a section of the pie chart should open a list view of all orders which have the
      corresponding size.
   #. Add a SCSS file and see if you can change the background color of the dashboard action.
