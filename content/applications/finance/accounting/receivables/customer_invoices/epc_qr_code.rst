============================
Add EPC QR Codes to invoices
============================
European Payments Council Quick Response Code, 
or **EPC QR Code**, are two-dimensional barcodes 
that customers can scan with their **mobile banking 
applications** to initiate a **SEPA Credit Transfer
(SCT)**, and pay their invoices instantly.

In addition to bringing ease of use and speed, 
it greatly reduces typing errors that would potentially 
make for payment issues. 

.. note::
   This feature is only available in several European 
   countries such as Austria, Belgium, Finland, Germany, 
   and The Netherlands.
   
Configuration
=============
Go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings` 
and activate the **SEPA QR Code** feature.

--> Journals`, open your *bank journal*, then fill out the 
*Bank Account* and *Bank* under the *Bank Account* tab.

Issue Invoices with EPC QR Codes
================================
EPC QR Codes are added automatically to your invoices, as 
long as you issue them to customers that are located in a 
country where this feature is available.

Go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Customers --> Invoices`, 
and create a new invoice. 

Before posting it, open the *Other Info* tab. Odoo automatically 
fills out the *Bank Account* field with your IBAN.

Make sure that the account indicated is the one you want to use to 
receive your customer’s payment as Odoo uses this field to generate 
the EPC QR Code.

.. tip::
   If you want to issue an invoice without an EPC QR Code, 
   remove the IBAN indicated in the *Bank Account* field, 
   under the *Other Info* tab of the invoice.
