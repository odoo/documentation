  <section id="how-to-setup-a-minimum-stock-rule"><p >For some items you hold in stock, it might be useful to have rules
making sure you never run out of stocks (for example, products with a
high demand, or large items requiring a lot of storage space meaning
they're harder to stock).</p><p >Odoo allows you to set up rules so that an automatic replenishment for
those items is made, based on minimum stocks available.</p></section><section id="when-should-i-use-reordering-rules"><h2 >When should I use Reordering Rules?</h2><p >Reordering Rules work best for items that have a high demand and high
flow. It will relieve you from a lot of work to focus on the rest of
your activities knowing that stocks will always be right.</p><p >It can also be used when you have limited storage space and you need to
keep large items in stock. In this case, you can keep as little as 1
item in stock, and have a new one ordered as a stock replenishment as
soon as the item in stock is sold.</p></section><section id="when-should-i-avoid-reordering-rules"><h2 >When should I avoid Reordering Rules?</h2><p >If you are offering a new product and don't know yet how fast it will
go, you should handle stocks yourself first, and setup reordering rules
only a few months into the sale to have better forecasts of the demand.</p><p >If you sell items that have a limited lifetime, such as fashion items,
technology items, or products working together with a system that is
meant to evolve, you have to be very well informed on when to stop
automated replenishments, in order to avoid having to sell these items
at a price that will not allow you to break even.</p></section><section id="example"><h2 >Example</h2><p >My company sells modern furniture. We sell a set of table and chairs
that are available in 4 seatings and 6 seatings.</p><p >To keep things simple, we stock tables and chairs separately, but sell
them all together to our clients as a kit. In order to make sure we can
always deliver a complete set of table and chairs, I setup a Reordering
Rule for the chairs to make sure I always have at least 10 chairs in
stock, but no more than 20. This way, I can sell up to 5 sets of table
at once while keeping my stock low enough not to eat up all my storage
space.</p><p >The last table I sold was a 4 seatings, and there were 12 chairs left in
my stock. Because the stock in chairs is now only 8 chairs, Odoo will
automatically order 12 new chairs to fill up my stock to the maximum
amount.</p></section><section id="configuration"><h2 >Configuration</h2></section><section id="set-up-your-product"><h3 >Set up your product</h3><p >In the Purchases module, open the Purchase menu and click on Products.
Open the product to which you would like to add a Reordering Rule (or
create a new one).</p><p >3 conditions for correct reordering rule :</p><ol ><li >In <span class="menuselection">General information ‣ Product type</span>, make the product
stockable (as soon as this is done, the icon &quot;Reordering rule will appear)</li><li >In <span class="menuselection">Inventory ‣ route</span>, tick the &quot;Buy&quot; box (and untick the
Make To Order box)</li><li >Select a vendor (don't forget to put a minimal quantity greater than 0)</li></ol></section><section id="create-a-reordering-rule"><h3 >Create a reordering rule</h3><p >Click on the Reordering Rules tab, click on Create.
