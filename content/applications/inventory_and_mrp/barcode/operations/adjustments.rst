Adjust inventory with barcodes
==============================

An *inventory adjustment*, or inventory audit, is the process of verifying the physical stock of
products against the quantities recorded in the database. Regular audits ensure accurate inventory
records, prevent stock discrepancies, and maintain efficient operations. In a warehouse setting,
managers typically assign inventory counts to employees, who then walk to designated locations, scan
product barcodes, and adjust quantities as needed.

Inventory adjustments can be completed through the **Barcode** application using a compatible
scanner, or the Odoo mobile app.

.. note::
   For a list of Odoo-compatible barcode mobile scanners, and other hardware for the **Inventory**
   and **Barcode** apps, refer to the `Odoo Inventory â€¢ Hardware page
   <https://www.odoo.com/app/inventory-hardware>`_.

.. tip::
   Odoo's **Barcode** application provides demo data with barcodes to explore the features of the
   app. These can be used for testing purposes, and can be printed from the home screen of the app.

   To access this demo data, navigate to the :menuselection:`Barcode app` and click :guilabel:`demo
   data sheet` or :guilabel:`barcodes` in the banner above the scanner.

Assigning inventory counts
==========================

Before performing an inventory count, managers can :ref:`assign <inventory/plan-counts>` counting
tasks to employees. This can be done through :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Operations -->
Physical Inventory` by selecting specific locations and products for counting, and assigning a
:guilabel:`User` to them. Once assigned, users will see pending counts when they open the
**Barcode** app.

To view a requested inventory count, navigate to the :menuselection:`Barcode app` dashboard. If a
count has been requested, the number of products to be counted is listed on the :guilabel:`Inventory
count` button.

.. image:: adjustments/assigned-count.png

Configuration
=============

Before an inventory adjustment can be performed with the **Barcode** app, the app has to be
installed, and configured. Navigate to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Settings`, and scroll to the :guilabel:`Barcode` section. Tick the checkbox next to
:guilabel:`Barcode Scanner`, and click :guilabel:`Save` to save any changes. If necessary, click
:guilabel:`Confirm` on the pop-up.

.. danger::
   Enabling the **Barcode** feature requires installing the **Barcode** application. Installing a
   new application on a One-App-Free database triggers a fifteen-day trial. At the end of the trial,
   if a paid subscription has not been added to the database, it will no longer be accessible.

After saving, a new drop-down menu appears under the :guilabel:`Barcode Scanner` option, labeled
:guilabel:`Barcode Nomenclature`, where either :guilabel:`Default Nomenclature` or
:guilabel:`Default GS1 Nomenclature` can be selected. Each nomenclature option determines how
scanners interpret barcodes in Odoo.

To count products using barcodes, ensure that barcodes for products and storage locations are set up
within Odoo first. Refer to this section for detailed instructions: :ref:`Set Product Barcodes
<inventory/barcode/set-barcodes>`.

Performing an inventory count
=============================

To perform an inventory adjustment, first navigate to the :menuselection:`Barcode app`. If assigned
counts exist, tap :guilabel:`Inventory Count` to view pending tasks.

.. image:: adjustments/adjustments-barcode-scanner.png
   :alt: Barcode app start screen with scanner.

Walk to the designated storage location, then scan the location barcode.

.. tip::
   If the warehouse *multi-location* feature is **not** enabled in the database, a source location
   does not need to be scanned. Instead, scan the product barcode to start the inventory adjustment.

Doing so highlights the location and displays all of the products stored there. Scan the barcode of
each product to adjust its count.

.. note::
   If no counts have been assigned to a user, and the :ref:`Count Entire Locations
   <inventory/barcode/count-location>` feature is **not** enabled, no products may appear after the
   location barcode is scanned.

Manually adjust quantities if necessary by tapping the :icon:`fa-pencil` :guilabel:`(edit)` icon.
Doing so opens a separate window with a keypad. Edit the number in the :guilabel:`Quantity` line to
change the quantity. Additionally, the :guilabel:`+1` and :guilabel:`-1` buttons can be clicked to
add or subtract quantity of the product, and the number keys can be used to add quantity, as well.

.. example::
   In the below inventory adjustment, the source location `WH/Stock/Shelf 1` was scanned, assigning
   the location. Then, the barcode for the product `[FURN_7888] Desk Stand with Screen` was scanned
   three times, increasing the units in the adjustment. Additional products can be added to this
   adjustment by scanning the barcodes for those specific products.

.. _inventory/barcode/count-location:

Count entire locations
----------------------

The :guilabel:`Count Entire Locations` feature assigns a user to count all the products within a
location once they scan the barcode for that location. This allows for easier cycle counts by
assigning an entire location to a user by assigning a single product count. During cycle counts,
users can ensure accurate inventory numbers, see if products that should be in a location are
missing, or discover products incorrectly stored within a location.

To enable this feature, navigate to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`,
and scroll to the :guilabel:`Barcode` section. Tick the :guilabel:`Count Entire Locations` checkbox,
then click :guilabel:`Save`.

.. important::
   This setting is only visible if the :guilabel:`Storage Locations` checkbox is ticked.

To perform an inventory count of an entire location, navigate to :menuselection:`Barcode app -->
Inventory Count`. Scan the desired location barcode. The app then displays all assigned products in
that location. :ref:`Proceed with the count <inventory/barcode/perform-count>` as normal.

Show quantity to count
----------------------

When conducting an inventory count, the expected quantity of products is displayed by default, to
provide the user with a baseline to use when performing the count. However, as this can result in
users relying on this count instead of performing a new count, this quantity can be hidden.

Navigate to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`. In the
:guilabel:`Barcode` section, clear the :guilabel:`Show Quantity to Count` checkbox, then click
:guilabel:`Save`.

.. image:: adjustments/show-quantity-to-count-disabled.png

Manually add products to an inventory count
===========================================

When barcodes for location or products are not available, Odoo **Barcode** can still be used to
perform inventory counts.

To do this, navigate to the :menuselection:`Barcode app --> Inventory Count`.

To manually add products to this adjustment, click the white :guilabel:`Add Product` button at the
bottom of the screen.

This navigates to a new, blank page where the desired product, quantity, and source location must be
chosen.

.. image:: adjustments/adjustments-keypad.png
   :alt: Keypad to add products on Barcode Inventory Client Action page.

First, click the :guilabel:`Product` line, and choose the product whose stock count should be
adjusted. Then, manually enter the quantity of that product, either by changing the `1` in the
:guilabel:`Quantity` line, or by clicking the :guilabel:`+1` and :guilabel:`-1` buttons to add or
subtract quantity of the product. The number pad can be used to add quantity, as well.

Below the number pad is the :guilabel:`location` line, which should read `WH/Stock` by default.
Click this line to reveal a drop-down menu of locations to choose from, and choose the
:guilabel:`source location` for this inventory adjustment.

Click :guilabel:`Confirm` to confirm the changes.

Finalizing an inventory count
=============================

After counting all of the products, review the entries to ensure all the counted quantities are
accurately entered. To complete the inventory adjustment, click :guilabel:`Apply`.

.. tip::
   The :guilabel:`Validate` barcode can be scanned in place of clicking the :guilabel:`Apply`
   button.

Odoo then navigates back to the :guilabel:`Barcode Scanning` screen. A small green banner appears in
the top-right corner, confirming the inventory count has been updated.
