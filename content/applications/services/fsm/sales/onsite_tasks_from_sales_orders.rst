===================================================
Create Onsite Interventions Tasks from Sales Orders
===================================================
By allowing your sales team to open onsite interventions tasks will create a seamless experience
for your customers. It also allows them to first receive a quotation with the materials that will
be used plus the service price to be approved before the work even starts.

Enable the feature
==================
Go to :menuselection:`Sales --> Products --> Create` or edit an existing one.
Select: under :menuselection:`General Information --> Product Type: Service`;
under :menuselection:`Sales --> Service Invoicing Policy: Timesheet on task --> Service Tracking:
Create a task in an existing project --> Project --> Worksheet Template --> Save`.

project you have chosen.

.. tip::
   One of the greatest benefits here is that you can have different *Worksheets Templates* under the
   same project and product, for example.
