Point of Sale
=============

Odoo **Point of Sale** is designed for managing shops and restaurants. It is web-browser-based,
allowing it to run on any device, and is built to maintain functionality even during temporary
network outages.

Beyond traditional :doc:`stores <point_of_sale/shop>` and :doc:`restaurants
<point_of_sale/restaurant>` settings, Odoo :abbr:`POS (Point of Sale)` also supports a
:doc:`self-ordering <point_of_sale/self_order>` feature, enabling customers to place orders and make
payments using a dedicated kiosk or their own mobile devices.

Odoo :abbr:`POS (Point of Sale)` integrates with all essential point-of-sale hardware, including:

- :doc:`Payment terminals <point_of_sale/payment_methods/terminals>`;
- Cash drawers;
- :doc:`Cash machines <point_of_sale/payment_methods/cash_machines>`;
- :ref:`Scales <pos/hardware/scale>`;
- :doc:`Barcode scanners <point_of_sale/shop/barcode>`;
- :ref:`Customer displays <pos/hardware/display>`;
- :doc:`Preparation displays <point_of_sale/preparation>`;
- :doc:`Electronic shelf labels <point_of_sale/pricing/electronic_labels>`.

This hardware can be connected directly or through an :doc:`IoT system <../general/iot>`.
