Scoring Surveys
===============

To measure your respondent’s performance, knowledge of a subject, or overall satisfaction, attach
points to the answers of specific questions. The points are summed up to give your respondent a
final score.

On your survey’s form, click on *Add a question* and, under the tab *Options*, choose between
*Scoring with answers at the end* or *Scoring without answers at the end*. Now, on your question’s
form, set the right answer and score.
