=====================================

Odoo Invoicing is your trusted partner for safe, efficient, and legally compliant e-invoicing
solutions tailored to meet Colombia's regulatory requirements and fully compatible with the
guidelines established by the `Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales (DIAN)
<https://www.dian.gov.co/>`_.

Legal framework for e-invoicing in Colombia
===========================================

Colombia has implemented mandatory e-invoicing for most businesses to enhance tax compliance and
improve transparency. Key elements include:

-  **Factura Electrónica**: Mandatory for B2B, B2C, and :abbr:`B2G (business-to-government)`
   transactions, requiring compliance with :abbr:`DIAN (Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas
   Nacionales)`'s technical specifications.
-  **Integration with DIAN**: All electronic invoices must be submitted to :abbr:`DIAN (Dirección de
   Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales)` for validation, where they are assigned a unique :abbr:`CUFE
   (Código Único de Factura Electrónica)` authorization code.
-  **Adoption of XML Standards**: Colombian e-invoicing uses XML as the standard format for
   electronic invoices, ensuring interoperability and standardized reporting.
