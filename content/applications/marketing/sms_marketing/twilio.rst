SMS via Twilio
==============

What is Twilio
==============

Twilio is a third-party provider that enables you to send SMS messages to your clients.
Odoo provides an easy way to use this service within your Odoo apps.

Why would I need it?
--------------------
Altough Odoo already comes with an out-of-the-box (IAP) solution for SMS messages, it might
now work in some countries with stricter legal requirements. Currently, Odoo registers
itself when possible to avoid extra setup for its customers, however in some countries
that is not enough and the client itself must do it. This can be done through Twilio.

Setup your Twilio account
=========================

By creating a Twilio account, you will be able to create a virtual phone number from
which you will be able to send SMS messages. These cost credits that are to be bought
on Twilio, not Odoo.

#. Go to https://www.twilio.com
#. Sign up and create an account
#. Complete your information

#. In your Dashboard, go to :menuselection:`Phone Numbers --> Manage --> Buy a number`
#. Buy a number (or use a trial one)
