.. _tutorials/website_theme/build_website/page:

Create a page
=============

Now that the theme has been set up, let's move on to creating the content.

First of all, start by creating your first theme page: the home page. For now, only indicate “Hello”
as content in the page.

.. tip::
   You will need to deactivate the default homepage.

.. seealso::
   See reference documentation on how to :ref:`desactivate a default page
   <website_themes/pages/default>` and how to :ref:`start a new page
   <website_themes/pages/theme_pages>`.

.. _tutorials/website_theme/build_website/media:

Add a media
===========

If you want the client to be able to reuse certain pictures that you are going to add on the
website, they must be added to the image library.

To do the test, declare the drone image to add it to the library. You will find the `drone picture
here <{GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/static/src/img/content/drone-robin.png>`_.

.. seealso::
   See reference documentation on how to :ref:`add a media <website_themes/media/images>`.

Go to the :guilabel:`Website Builder`, double-click on the :guilabel:`logo`, and you will see the
drone image in the library.

.. spoiler:: Solutions

   To complete this exercise, you need to:

   #. Put your PNG in the right image folder.
   #. Create your :file:`images.xml` file. You can find all the necessary information
      in the `images.xml
      <{GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/data/images.xml>`_
      file from our example module.
   #. Declare your file in the :file:`__manifest__.py`.

.. _tutorials/website_theme/build_website/building_blocks:

Add building blocks
===================

Now, let's get into the real work. Start adding content to the pages.

In an Odoo website, we create the content of a page using building blocks. These can be compared to
snippets editable by the user in the Website Builder. The standard main container for any snippet
is a `section`.

Based on the Airproof design, add the following elements to the homepage :

- Create a section with the 3 boxes using the :guilabel:`Big boxes` building block.

  - For this section, you don't want the future user to be able to edit it via the Website Builder.
  - Put an opacity filter on the background image of the 3 boxes.

- Create another section containing the title and icons.

You can use these `images <{GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/static/src/img/content>`_ and `icons
<{GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/static/src/img/content/icons>`_.

.. seealso::
   See reference documentation on how to :ref:`write standard snippets
   <website_themes/building_blocks/layout>`.

   :scale: 75%

.. tip::
   To determine the code needed to create your building blocks :

   - | Create a test page via the website builder.
     | Drag & drop the building block that interests you and apply the right design.
     | Use the code generated via :guilabel:`Editor HTML/SCSS` in the menu.
   - You can also find the original building block code in Odoo :
     :file:`odoo/addons/website/views/snippets/**.xml`.

   <{GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/data/pages/home.xml>`_.

.. _tutorials/website_theme/build_website/navigation:

Navigation
==========

For now, the client is fine with the default header but has requested some navigation adjustments.

The client has requested the following changes:

- Remove the link to the homepage and the shop.
- Add a link to the future “About us” page.
- Replace the default blog item with a dropdown to display the different blogs: “Our latest news”
  and “Tutorials”.
- Add a mega-menu “Waterproof drones” to display the different products.

.. seealso::
   - You can find the original mega-menu templates code in Odoo :
     `odoo/addons/website/views/snippets/s_mega_menu_**.xml
     <{GITHUB_PATH}/addons/website/views/snippets>`_
   - See reference documentation on how to modifiy the
     :doc:`/developer/howtos/website_themes/navigation`.

.. image:: 02_build_website/mega-menu.png
   :alt: Aiproof mega-menu.

.. tip::
   - Make sure the Blog app is installed and create the two different blogs in the backend.
   - Create the different products via the backend. You can use these `product pictures
     <{GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/static/src/img/content>`_.

   Find the solution in our Airproof example on `menu.xml
   <{GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/data/menu.xml>`_.
