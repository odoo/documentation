And if you want to avoid having to reassign the variable you may move the entire block that uses the variable inside the `try` block. The more code you have inside your `try` block, the more likely you are to catch unrelated errors, and swallow them if you forgot to filter by error type.

Remember that the JavaScript/Python data types used to represent the values given by ``read()`` and given to ``write()`` is not necessarily the same in Odoo. As example, when you read a many2one, it is always a tuple whose first value is the id of the pointed record and the second one is the name get (ie: ``(15, \"Agrolait\")``).
