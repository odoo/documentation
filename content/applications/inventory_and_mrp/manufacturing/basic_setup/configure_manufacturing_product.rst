Configuração do produto de fabricação

In order to manufacture a product in Odoo *Manufacturing*, the product must be properly configured.
Doing so consists of enabling the *Manufacturing* route and configuring a bill of materials (BoM)
for the product. Once these steps are completed, the product is selectable when creating a new
manufacturing order.

Activate the Manufacture route
==============================

The Manufacture route is activated for each product on its own product page. To do so, begin by
navigating to :menuselection:`Manufacturing --> Products --> Products`. Then, select an existing
product, or create a new one by clicking :guilabel:`New`.

On the product page, select the :guilabel:`Inventory` tab, then enable the :guilabel:`Manufacture`
checkbox in the :guilabel:`Routes` section. This tells Odoo the product can be manufactured.

.. _manufacturing/basic_setup/lot-serial-tracking:

Lot/serial number tracking
--------------------------

The assignment of lots or serial numbers to newly manufactured products is optional. To optionally
:doc:`assign lots or serial numbers <../../inventory/product_management/product_tracking>`
to newly manufactured products, go to the :guilabel:`Traceability` section in the
:guilabel:`Inventory` tab. In the :guilabel:`Tracking` field, select :guilabel:`By Unique Serial
Number` or :guilabel:`By Lots`.

Doing so enables the *Lot/Serial Number* field on a manufacturing order, or the *Register
Production* instruction on a work order card in the *Shop Floor* app.

Configure a bill of materials (BoM)
===================================

Next, a |BOM| must be configured for the product so Odoo knows how it is manufactured. A |BOM| is a
list of the components and operations required to manufacture a product.

To create a |BOM| for a specific product, navigate to :menuselection:`Manufacturing --> Products -->
Products`, then select the product. On the product page, click the :guilabel:`Bill of Materials`
smart button at the top of the page, then select :guilabel:`New` to configure a new |BOM|.

On the |BOM|, the :guilabel:`Product` field auto-populates with the product. In the
:guilabel:`Quantity` field, specify the number of units that the BoM produces.

Add a component to the |BOM| by selecting the :guilabel:`Components` tab and clicking :guilabel:`Add
a line`. Select a component from the :guilabel:`Component` drop-down menu, then enter the quantity
in the :guilabel:`Quantity` field. Continue adding components on new lines until all components have
been added.

Next, select the :guilabel:`Operations` tab. Click :guilabel:`Add a line` and a :guilabel:`Create
Operations` pop-up window appears. In the :guilabel:`Operation` field, specify the name of the
operation being added (e.g. Assemble, Cut, etc.). Select the work center where the operation will be
carried out from the :guilabel:`Work Center` drop-down menu. Finally, click :guilabel:`Save & Close`
to finish adding operations, or :guilabel:`Save & New` to add more.

.. important::
   The :guilabel:`Operations` tab only appears if the :guilabel:`Work Orders` setting is enabled. To
   do so, navigate to :menuselection:`Manufacturing --> Configuration --> Settings`, then enable the
   :guilabel:`Work Orders` checkbox.

   The section above provides instructions for creating a basic |BOM| that allows a product to be
   manufactured in Odoo. However, it is by no means an exhaustive summary of all the options
   available when configuring a |BOM|. For more information about bills of materials, see the
   documentation on how to :doc:`create a bill of materials <bill_configuration>`.
