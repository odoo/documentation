Self-signed certificate for ePOS printers
=========================================

To work with Odoo, some printer models that can be used without an
:doc:`IoT system </applications/general/iot>` may require :doc:`the HTTPS protocol <https>` to
establish a secure connection between the browser and the printer. However, trying to reach the
printer's IP address using HTTPS leads to a warning page on most web browsers. In that case, you can
temporarily :ref:`force the connection <epos_ssc/instructions>`, which allows you to reach the page
in HTTPS and use the ePOS printer in Odoo as long as the browser window stays open.

.. warning::
   The connection is lost after closing the browser window. Therefore, this method should only be
   used as a **workaround** or as a pre-requisite for the :ref:`following instructions
   <epos_ssc/instructions>`.

Generate, export, and import self-signed certificates
=====================================================

For a long-term solution, you must generate a **self-signed certificate**. Then, export and import
it into your browser.

.. important::
   **Generating** an SSL certificate should only be done **once**. If you create another
   certificate, devices using the previous one will lose HTTPS access.

         .. tab:: Generate a self-signed certificate

            Navigate to the ePOS' IP address (e.g., `https://192.168.1.25`) and force the
            connection by clicking :guilabel:`Advanced` and :guilabel:`Proceed to [IP address]
            (unsafe)`.

            Then, sign in using your printer credentials to access the ePOS printer settings. To
            sign in, enter `epson` in the :guilabel:`ID` field and your printer serial number in the
            :guilabel:`Password` field.

            Click :guilabel:`Certificate List` in the :guilabel:`Authentication` section, and click
            :guilabel:`create` to generate a new **Self-Signed Certificate**. The :guilabel:`Common
            Name` should be automatically filled out. If not, fill it in with the printer IP address
            number. Select the years the certificate will be valid in the :guilabel:`Validity
            Period` field, click :guilabel:`Create`, and :guilabel:`Reset` or manually restart the
            printer.

            The self-signed certificate is generated. Reload the page and click :guilabel:`SSL/TLS`
            in the :guilabel:`Security` section to ensure **Selfsigned Certificate** is correctly
            selected in the :guilabel:`Server Certificate` section.

         .. tab:: Export a self-signed certificate

            The export process is heavily dependent on the :abbr:`OS (Operating System)` and the
            browser. Start by accessing your ePOS printer settings on your web browser by navigating
            to its IP address (e.g., `https://192.168.1.25`). Then, force the connection as
            explained in the **Generate a self-signed certificate tab**.

            If you are using **Google Chrome**,

            #. click :guilabel:`Not secure` next to the search bar, and :guilabel:`Certificate is
               not valid`;

            #. add `.crt` at the end of the file name to ensure it has the correct extension;
            #. select :guilabel:`Base64-encoded ASCII, single certificate`, at the bottom of the
               pop-up window;
            #. save, and the certificate is exported.

            .. warning::
               Make sure that the certificate ends with the extension `.crt`. Otherwise, some
               browsers might not see the file during the import process.

               .. tab:: Windows 10

                  Windows 10 manages certificates, which means that self-signed certificates must be
                  imported from the certification file rather than the browser. To do so,

                  #. open the Windows File Explorer and locate the downloaded certification file;
                  #. right-click on the certification file and click :guilabel:`Install
                     Certificate`;
                  #. select where to install the certificate and for whom - either for the
                     :guilabel:`Current User` or all users (:guilabel:`Local Machine`). Then, click
                     :guilabel:`Next`;
                  #. on the `Certificate Store` screen, tick :guilabel:`Place all certificates in
                     the following store`, click :guilabel:`Browse...`, and select
                     :guilabel:`Trusted Root Certification Authorities`;

                     .. image:: epos_ssc/win-cert-wizard-store.png

                  #. click :guilabel:`Finish`, accept the pop-up security window;
                  #. restart the computer to make sure that the changes are applied.

               .. tab:: Linux

                  If you are using **Google Chrome**,

                  #. go to :menuselection:`Settings --> Privacy and security --> Security -->
                     Manage certificates`;
                  #. go to the :guilabel:`Authorities` tab, click :guilabel:`Import`, and select
                     the exported certification file;
                  #. accept all warnings;
                  #. click :guilabel:`ok`;
                  #. restart your browser.

                  #. go to :menuselection:`Settings --> Privacy & Security --> Security --> View
                     Certificates... --> Import`;

                  #. tick the checkboxes and validate;
                  #. restart your browser.

   .. tab:: Mac OS

      On Mac OS, you can secure the connection for all browsers by following these steps:

      #. open Safari and navigate to your printer's IP address. Doing so leads to a warning page;
      #. on the warning page,  go to :menuselection:`Show Details --> visit this website --> Visit
         Website`, validate;
      #. reboot the printer so you can use it with any other browser.

      #. select the certificate file to install it on the device.

      .. Note::
         The specific steps for installing a certificate may vary depending on the version of
         Android and the device manufacturer.

   .. tab:: iOS

      To import an SSL certificate into an iOS device, first create and export it from a computer.
      Then, transfer the `.crt` file to the device using email, Bluetooth, or any file-sharing
      service.

      Downloading this file triggers a warning pop-up window. Click :guilabel:`Allow` to download
      the configuration profile, and close the second pop-up window. Then,

         window;
      #. click :guilabel:`Done`.

      #. enable the installed certificate using the **slide button**;
      #. click :guilabel:`Continue` on the pop-up window.

.. important::
   - If you need to export SSL certificates from an operating system or web browser that has not
     been mentioned, search for `export SSL certificate` + `the name of your browser or operating
     system` in your preferred search engine.
   - Similarly, to import SSL certificates from an unmentioned OS or browser, search for `import SSL
     certificate root authority` + `the name of your browser or operating system` in your preferred
     search engine.

Check if the certificate was imported correctly
===============================================

To confirm your printer's connection is secure, connect to its IP address using HTTPS. For example,
navigate to `https://192.168.1.25` in your browser. If the SSL certificate has been applied
correctly, you should no longer see a warning page, and the address bar should display a padlock
icon, indicating that the connection is secure.
