Legal framework for e-invoicing in Ecuador
==========================================

Ecuador has implemented mandatory electronic invoicing for most businesses aimed to enhance tax
compliance and transparency. Key elements include:

- **Factura Electr√≥nica**: All businesses must issue electronic invoices in XML format for B2B, B2C,
  and :abbr:`B2G (business-to-government)` transactions, ensuring compliance with :abbr:`SRI
  (Servicio de Rentas Internas)`'s technical specifications.
- **Transmission Requirements**: E-invoices must be transmitted to the SRI within 24 hours of
  issuance.
- **Record Storage**: E-invoices, including the :abbr:`SRI (Servicio de Rentas Internas)`'s
  acceptance messages, must be stored for a minimum of seven years.
