.. danger:: If you do not check the "For testing purposes" checkbox when
  duplicating a database, all external communication will remain active:

  * Emails are sent

  * Payments are processed (in the e-commerce or Subscriptions apps, for example)

  * Delivery orders (shipping providers) are sent

  * Etc.

  Make sure to check the checkbox "For testing purposes" if you want these
  behaviours to be disabled.

After a few seconds, you will be logged in your duplicated database.
Notice that the url uses the name you chose for your duplicated
database.
