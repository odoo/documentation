Activate the Barcodes in Odoo
=============================

.. _inventory/barcode/software:

The barcode scanning features can save you a lot of time usually lost
switching between the keyboard, the mouse and the scanner. Properly
attributing barcodes to products, pickings locations, etc. allows you to
work more efficiently by controlling the software almost exclusively
with the barcode scanner.

Configuration
=============

To use this feature, you first need to activate the *Barcode*
functionality via :menuselection:`Inventory --> Settings --> Barcode Scanner`. Once you
have ticked the feature, you can hit save.

Set Product Barcodes
====================

You can easily assign barcodes to your different products via the
*Inventory* app. To do so, go to :menuselection:`Settings --> Configure Products Barcodes`.

Then, you have the possibility to assign barcodes to your products
directly at creation on the product form.

.. note::
         Be careful to add barcodes directly on the product variants and not on
         the template product. Otherwise, you wonâ€™t be able to differentiate
         them.

.. _barcode/setup/location:

Set Locations Barcodes
======================

If you manage multiple locations, you will find useful to attribute a
barcode to each location and stick it on the location. You can configure
the locations barcodes in :menuselection:`Inventory --> Configuration --> Locations`.

.. note::
         You can easily print the barcode you allocate to the locations via the
         *Print* menu.

Barcode Formats
===============

Most retail products use EAN-13 barcodes, also known as GTIN (Global Trade Identification Numbers).
GTIN are used by companies to uniquely identify their products and services. While GTIN and UPC are
often used synonymously, GTIN refers to the number a barcode represents, while UPC refers to the
barcode itself. More information about GTIN can be found on the GS1 website.

In order to create GTIN for items, a company must have a GS1 Company Prefix. This prefix is the
number that will appear at the beginning of each GTIN, and will identify the company as the owner of
the barcode any the products it appears on. To learn more about GS1 Company Prefixes, or purchase a
license for a prefix, visit the GS1 Company Prefix page.

Odoo users are able to use GTIN barcodes to identify their products. However, since Odoo supports
any numeric string as a barcode, it is also possible to define a custom barcode for internal use.

.. _barcode/setup/barcodelookup:

Barcode Lookup
==============

`Barcode Lookup <https://www.barcodelookup.com/>`_ allows you to scan (or enter) products' barcodes
(:abbr:`UPC (Universal Product Code)`, :abbr:`EAN (European Article Number)`, or :abbr:`ISBN
(International Standard Book Number)`) to automatically create them in your Odoo database, complete
with product names, descriptions, images, categories, etc.

To use Barcode Lookup to scan and create products in Barcode, go to :menuselection:`Inventory -->
Configuration --> Settings`, scroll down to the :guilabel:`Barcode` section, and enable
:guilabel:`Stock Barcode Database`.

.. note::
   If your database is hosted on **Odoo.sh** or **on-premise**, you must also :ref:`configure
   an API key <barcodelookup/configuration>`.
   If your database is hosted on **Odoo Online**, you can use Barcode Lookup without further
   configuration.
