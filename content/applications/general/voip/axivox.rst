Use VoIP services in Odoo with Axivox
=====================================

Introduction
============

Odoo VoIP can be set up to work together with `Axivox <https://www.axivox.com/>`_. In that case, an
:doc:`Asterisk server <asterisk>` is not necessary as the infrastructure is hosted and managed by
Axivox.

To use this service, `contact Axivox <https://www.axivox.com/contact/>`_ to open an account. Before
doing so, verify that Axivox covers your area and the areas you wish to call.

Configuration
=============

Go to :menuselection:`Apps` and install the **VoIP Module**.
