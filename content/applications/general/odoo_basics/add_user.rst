How to add a user
=================

Odoo provides you with the option to add additional users at any given
point.

Add individual users
====================

From the Settings module, go to the submenu :menuselection:`Users --> Users` and click on
**CREATE.** First add the name of your new user and the professional
email address - the one he will use to log into Odoo instance - and a
picture.

Under Access Rights, you can choose which applications your user can
access and use. Different levels of rights are available depending on
the app.

When youâ€™re done editing the page and have clicked on **SAVE**, an
invitation email will automatically be sent to the user. The user must
click on it to accept the invitation to your instance and create a
log-in.

.. tip::
    You can also add a new user on the fly from your dashboard. From the above screenshot,
    enter the email address of the user you would like to add and click on **INVITE**.
    The user will receive an email invite containing a link to set his password. You
    will then be able to define his accesses rights under the :menuselection:`Settings --> Users menu`.
