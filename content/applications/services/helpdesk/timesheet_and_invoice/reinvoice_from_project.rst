Invoice Time Spent on Tickets (Postpaid Support Services)

Directly pull the billable time you have tracked on your helpdesk tickets into sales orders and
invoices through a project task. It gives you more control over what you charge your client, and it
is more efficient.

  *Timesheet on Ticket* and *Time Reinvoicing*.
| Under *Timesheet on Ticket*, choose the *Project* to which tickets (and timesheets) will be
  linked by default. Open its *External link* to enable the feature *Bill from tasks*.
