Introduction
============

The Peruvian localization has been improved and extended, in this version the next modules are 
available:

- **l10n_pe**: Adds accounting features for the Peruvian localization, which represent the minimal
  configuration required for a company to operate in Peru and under the SUNAT regulations and 
  guidelines. The main elements included in this module are: Chart of account, taxes, 
  document types. 

- **l10n_pe_edi**: includes all technical and functional requirements to generate and validate 
  Electronic Invoice, based on the SUNAT specification to create and process valid electronic 
  documents, for more technical detail you can access the   
  `SUNAT EDI specifications <https://cpe.sunat.gob.pe/node/88/>`_,
  that keeps track of new changes and updates.  
  The features of this module are based on the resolutions published on the 
  `SUNAT Legislation <https://www.sunat.gob.pe/legislacion/general/index.html/>`_.

Configuration
=============

Install the Peruvian localization modules
-----------------------------------------

Go to *Apps* and search for Peru, then click Install in the module Peru EDI. This module has a 
dependency with *Peru - Accounting*. In case this last one is not installed, Odoo installs it
automatically within EDI.

   :align: center
   :alt: The "Module" filter is set on "Peru" 

.. note::
   When you install a database from scratch selecting Peru as country, Odoo automatically 
   installs the base module: Peru - Accounting.
  
Configure your company
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the basic information in the Company, we need to set Peru as the Country, this is
essential for the Electronic Invoice to work properly. The field **Address Type Code** represents 
the establishment code assigned by the SUNAT when companies register their RUC (Unique Contributor 
Registration):

.. image:: media/peru-company.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Company data for Peru including RUC and Address type code


.. tip::
   In case the Address type code is unknown,  you can set it as the default value: 0000. Be aware 
   that if an incorrect value is entered, the Electronic invoice validation might have errors. 
 
.. note::
   The NIF should be set following the RUC format.

   
Chart of Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The chart of accounts is installed by default as part of the set of data included in the 
localization module, the accounts are mapped automatically in: 

- Taxes
- Default Account Payable.
- Default Account Receivable

The chart of accounts for Peru is based on the most updated version of the :abbr:`PCGE (Plan
Contable General Empresarial)`, which is grouped in several categories and is compatible with NIIF
accounting.

Accouting Seetings
------------------

Once the modules are installed and the basic information of your company is set, you need to 
configure the elements required for Electronic Invoice. For this, go to :menuselection:`Accounting 
--> Settings --> Peruvian Localization`.

Basic Concepts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are some terms that are essential on the Peruvian localization: 

- **EDI**: Electronic Data Interchange, which in this refers to the Electronic Invoice. 
- **SUNAT**: is the organization that enforces customs and taxation in Peru.
- **OSE**: Electronic Service Operator, `OSE SUNAT's definition 
  <https://cpe.sunat.gob.pe/aliados/ose#:~:text=El%20Operador%20de%20Servicios%20Electr%C3%B3nicos%20(OSE)%20es%20qui%C3%A9n%20se%20encarga,otro%20documento%20que%20se%20emita>`_.
- **CDR**: Receipt certificate (Constancia de Recepción). 
- **SOL Credentials**: User and password provided by the SUNAT and grants access to Online 
  Operations systems. 


Signature Provider
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of  the requirements for Electronic Invoice in Peru, your company needs to select a
Signature Provider that will take care of the document signing process and manage the SUNAT
validation response. Odoo offers three options:

#. IAP (Odoo In-App Purchase)
#. Digiflow
#. SUNAT

Please refer to the sections below to check the details and considerations for each option.

IAP (Odoo In-App Purchase)
**************************

This is the default and the suggested option, considering the digital ceritificate is included as
part of the service. 

.. image:: media/peru-IAP.png
   :align: center
   :alt: IAP option as signature providers
   
What is the IAP?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a signature service offered directly by Odoo, the service takes care of the next process:

#. Provides the Electronic invoice Certificate, so you do not need to acquire one by yourself.
#. Send the document to the OSE, in this case, Digiflow.
#. Receive the OSE validation and CDR.

How does it work?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The service requires Credits in order to process your electronic documents. Odoo provides 1000
credits for free in new databases. After these credits are consumed, you need to buy a Credit
Package.

+---------+-----+
| Credits | EUR |
+=========+=====+
| 1000    | 22  |
+---------+-----+
| 5000    | 110 |
+---------+-----+
| 10,000  | 220 |
+---------+-----+
| 20,000  | 440 |
+---------+-----+

The credits are consumed per each document that is sent to the OSE. 

.. important::
   If you have a validation error and the document needs to be sent one more time, one additional 
   credit will be charged. Therefore, it is paramount that you verify all information is correct 
   before sending your document to the OSE.

What do you need to do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- In Odoo, once your enterprise contract is activated and you start working in Production, you 
  need to buy credits once the first 1000 are consumed.
- As Digiflow is the OSE used in the IAP, you need to affiliate it as the official OSE for your 
  company on the SUNAT website. This is a simple process. For more information, please check
  `OSE Affiliation guide 
  <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BkrMTZIiJyi5XI0lGMi3rbMzHddOL1pa/view?usp=sharing>`_.
   
Digiflow
********

This option can be used as an alternative, instead of using the IAP services you can send your 
document validation directly to Digiflow. In this case you need to consider:

- Buy your own digital Certificate: For more detail regarding the official vendor list, and the 
  process to acquire it, please refer to `SUNAT Digital Ceritifcates 
  <https://cpe.sunat.gob.pe/informacion_general/certificados_digitales/>`_.
- Sign a service agreement directly with `Digiflow <https://www.digiflow.pe/>`_.
- Provide your SOL credentials.

.. image:: media/peru-Digiflow.png

   :alt: Digiflow

SUNAT
*****

In case your company wants to sign directly with the SUNAT, it is possible to select this option 
in your configuration. In this case you need to consider:
- Get the SUNAT Certification process accepted.

- Buy your own digital Certificate: For more detail regarding the official vendor list, and the 
  process to acquire it, please refer to `SUNAT Digital Ceritifcates 
  <https://cpe.sunat.gob.pe/informacion_general/certificados_digitales/>`_.
  
- Provide you SOL credentials.


Testing environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Odoo provides a testing environment that can be activated before your company goes into production. 

When using the testing environment and the IAP signature, you don’t need to buy testing credits 
for your transactions as all of them are validated by default.

.. tip::
   By default the databases are set to work on production, make sure to enable the testing mode 
   if needed. 

Certificate
~~~~~~~~~~~

In case you don’t use Odoo IAP, in order to generate the electronic invoice signature, a digital
certificate with the extension ``.pfx`` is required. Proceed to this section and load your file and
password.

.. image:: media/peru-Certificate.png
   :align: center
   :alt: EDI Certificate wizard
   
Multicurrency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The official currency exchange rate in Peru is provided by the Bank of Peru. Odoo can connect 
directly to its services and get the currency rate either automatically or manually.

.. image:: media/peru-multicurrency.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Bank of Peru is displayed in Multicurrency Service option
   
Please refer to the next section in our documentation for more information about :doc:`multicurrency
<../../others/multicurrencies/how_it_works>`.


Configure Master data
---------------------

Taxes
~~~~~

As part of the localization module the taxes are created automatically with their related 
financial account and electronic invoice configuration.

   :alt: List of default taxes

EDI Configuration
*****************

As part of the taxes configuration, there are three new fields required for electronic invoice, 
the taxes created by default have this data included, but in case you create new taxes make 
sure you fill in the fields: 

.. image:: media/peru-taxes-edi.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Taxes EDI data for Peru


Fiscal Positions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two main fiscal positions included by default when you install the Peruvian localization.

**Extranjero - Exportación**: Set this fiscal position on customers for Exportation transactions.

**Local Peru**: Set this fiscal position on local customers.

Document Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some Latin American countries, including Peru, some accounting transactions like invoices and 
vendor bills are classified by document types, defined by the government fiscal authorities, in 
this case by the SUNAT. 

Each document type can have a unique sequence per journal where it is assigned. As part of the 
localization, the Document Type includes the country on which the document is applicable;the data 
is created automatically when the localization module is installed.
 
The information required for the document types is included by default so the user does not need 
to fill anything on this view:

.. image:: media/peru-document-type.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Document Type list

.. warning::
   Currently the documents supported on customer invoices are: Invoice, Boleta, Debit Note and 
   Credit Note.

Journals
~~~~~~~~

When creating Sales Journals, the following information must be filled, in addition to the standard
fields on the Journals:

Use Documents 
*************

This field is used to define if the journal uses Document Types. It is only applicable to 
Purchase and Sales journals, which are the ones that can be related to the different set of 
document types available in Peru. By default, all the sales journals created use documents. 

Electronic Data Interchange
***************************

This  section indicates which EDI workflow is used in the invoice, for Peru we must select 
“Peru UBL 2.1”.

.. image:: media/peru-journal-edi.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Journal EDI field

.. warning::
   By default, the value Factur-X (FR) is always displayed, make sure you can uncheck it manually.

Partner
~~~~~~~

Identification Type and VAT
***************************

As part of the Peruvian localization, the identification types defined by the SUNAT are now 
available on the Partner form, this information is essential for most transactions either on 
the sender company and in the customer, make sure you fill in this information in your records.

.. image:: media/peru-id-type.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Partner identification type


Product
~~~~~~~

Additional to the basic information in your products, for the Peruvian localization, the UNSPC 
Code on the product is a required value to be configured.

Usage and testing
=================

Customer invoice
----------------

EDI Elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have configured your master data, the invoices can be created from your sales order or
manually. Additional to the basic invoice information described on :doc:`our page about the
invoicing process <../../receivables/customer_invoices/overview>`, there are a couple of fields 
required as part of the Peru EDI:

- **Document type**: The default value is “Factura Electronica” but  you can manually change the 
  document type if needed and select Boleta for example. 

  .. image:: media/peru-invoice-document-type.png
     :align: center
     :alt: Invoice document type field on invoices

- **Operation type**: This value is required for Electronic Invoice and indicates the transaction 
  type, the default value is “Internal Sale” but another value can be selected manually when needed, 
  for example Export of Goods. 

  .. image:: media/peru-operation-type.png
     :align: center
     :alt: Invoice operation type field on invoices

- **EDI Affectation Reason**: In the invoice lines, additional to the Tax there is a field “EDI 
  Affectation Reason” that determines the tax scope based on the SUNAT list that is displayed. 
  All the taxes loaded by default are associated with a default EDI affection reason, if needed 
  you can manually select another one when creating the invoice.

  .. image:: media/peru-tax-affectation-reason.png
     :align: center
     :alt: Tax affectation reason in invoice line

Invoice validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you check all the information in your invoice is correct, you can proceed to validate it. This
action registers the account move and triggers the Electronic invoice workflow to send it to the 
OSE and the SUNAT. The following message is displayed at the top of the invoice:

.. image:: media/peru-posted-invoice.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Sending of EDI Invoice in blue

Asynchronous means that the document is not sent automatically after the invoice has been posted. 

Electronic Invoice Status
*************************

**To be Sent**: To be sent: Indicates the document is ready to be sent to the OSE, this can be 
done either automatically by Odoo with a *cron* that runs every hour, or the user can send it 
immediately by clicking on the button “Sent now”.

.. image:: media/peru-sent-manual.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Send EDI manually

**Sent**: Indicates the document was sent to the OSE and was successfully validated. As part of 
the validation a ZIP file is downloaded and a message is logged in the chatter indicating the 
correct Government validation.  

.. image:: media/peru-invoice-sent.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Message on chatter when the invoice is valid

In case there is a validation error the Electronic Invoice status remains in “To be sent” so the 
corrections can be made and the invoice can be sent again. 

.. warning::
   One credit is consumed each time that you send a document for validation, in this sense if an 
   error is detected on an invoice and you send it one more time, two credits are consumed in 
   total.

Common Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are multiple reasons behind a rejection from the OSE or the SUNAT, when this happens Odoo 
sends a message at the top of the invoice indicating the error details and in the most common 
cases a hint to fix the issue. 

If a validation error is received, you have two options: 

- In case the error is related to master data on the partner, customer or taxes, you can simply
  apply the change on the record (example customer identification type) and once it is done click 
  on the Retry button. 
- If the error is related to some data recorded on the invoice directly (Operation type, missing 
  data on the invoice lines), the correct solution is to reset the invoice to Draft, apply the 
  changes, and then send the invoice again to the SUNAT for another validation. 

  .. image:: media/peru-errors.png

     :alt: List of common errors on invoices


For more detail please refert to `Common errors in SUNAT 
<https://www.nubefact.com/codigos-error-sunat/>`_.

Invoice PDF Report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the invoice is accepted and validated by the SUNAT, the invoice PDF report can be printed. 
The report includes a QR code, indicating the invoice is a valid fiscal document.

IAP Credits
~~~~~~~~~~~

Odoo’s Electronic IAP offers 1000 credits for free, after these credits are consumed in your 
production database, your company must buy new credits in order to process your transactions. 

Once you run out of credits a red label is displayed at the top of the invoice indicating that 
additional credits are required, you can easily buy them by accessing the link provided in 
the message. 

.. image:: media/peru-credits-IAP.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Buying credits in the IAP

In the IAP service includes packages with different pricing based on the number of credits. 
The price list in the IAP is always displayed in EUR.

Special Use cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cancelation process
*******************

Some scenarios require an invoice cancellation, for example, when an invoice was created by mistake. 
If the invoice was already sent and validated by the SUNAT, the correct way to proceed is by 
clicking on the button Request Cancellation:

In order to cancel an invoice, please provide a cancellation Reason. 

Electronic Invoice Status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**To Cancel**:  Indicates the cancellation request is ready to be sent to the OSE, this can be done 
either automatically by Odoo with a *cron* that runs every hour, or the user can send it 
immediately by clicking on the button “Send now”. Once it is sent, a cancellation ticket is 
created, as a result the next message and CDR File are logged in the chatter:

.. image:: media/peru-cancellation-cdr.png
   :align: center
