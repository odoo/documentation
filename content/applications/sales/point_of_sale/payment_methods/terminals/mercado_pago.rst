Mercado Pago

Connecting a payment terminal allows you to offer a fluid payment flow to your customers and ease
the work of your cashiers.

.. important::
   Only **Point Smart** payment terminals in **Argentina**, **Brazil**, and **Mexico** are
   supported. They can be purchased on `Mercado Pago's website
   <https://www.mercadopago.com.mx/herramientas-para-vender/lectores-point>`_.

Point Smart application
-----------------------

Create a new application from Mercado Pago's `developer panel
<https://www.mercadopago.com/developers>`_ by following `Mercado Pago's applications documentation
<https://www.mercadopago.com.mx/ayuda/20152>`_, making sure you select :guilabel:`In
person Payments`.

.. _pos-mercado-pago-credentials:

Credentials
-----------

Once the Point Smart application is created, three credentials are required:

- An access token that Odoo uses to call Mercado Pago.
- A webhook secret key that Odoo uses to authenticate notifications sent by Mercado Pago.
- The **terminal serial number** at the back of your Point Smart terminal.

Retrieve the access token and webhook secret key by following `Mercado Pago's credentials
documentation <https://www.mercadopago.com.mx/developers/en/docs/your-integrations/credentials>`_.
Then, copy and paste them into Odoo when creating the payment method.

.. important::
   For the webhooks configuration, add the URL of your Odoo database (e.g.,
   `https://mycompany.odoo.com`) followed by `/pos_mercado_pago/notification` (e.g.,
   `https://mycompany.odoo.com/pos_mercado_pago/notification`).

.. _pos-mercado-pago-pay:

Paying with a payment terminal
==============================

When processing a payment, select your Mercado Pago payment method, check the amount, and click
:guilabel:`Send`. Once the payment is successful, the status changes to :guilabel:`Payment
Successful`.

.. note::
   - In case of connection issues between Odoo and the payment terminal, force the payment by
     clicking :guilabel:`Force Done`, which allows you to validate the order. This option is only
     available after receiving an error message informing you that the connection failed.
   - To cancel the payment request, click :guilabel:`Cancel`.

.. important::
   Any action made on the terminal should trigger a notification on the POS interface. Ensure the
   :ref:`webhook secret key <pos-mercado-pago-credentials>` is correctly configured if you are not
   notified.
