FAQ
===

I have an error when I try to delete my synchronization within Odoo
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Odoo can't permanently delete the connection you have created with the banking institution. However, 
it can revoke the consent you gave so that Odoo won't be able to access your account anymore. The 
error you are seeing is probably a message telling you that the consent was revoked, but the record 
could not be deleted as it still exists within Salt edge. If you want to remove the connection 
completely, please connect to your `Salt Edge account <https://www.saltedge.com/dashboard>`_ 
and manually delete your synchronization. Once this is done, you can go back to Odoo to delete the 
record.

I have an error saying that I have already synchronized this account
--------------------------------------------------------------------

You have probably already synchronized your bank account with Salt Edge, please check on your `dashboard
<https://www.saltedge.com/dashboard>`_ that you don't already have a connection with the same
credentials.

In case you already have a synchronization with the same credentials present on your Salt Edge
dashboard and this synchronization has not been created with Odoo, please delete it and create it
from your Odoo database.

In case you already have a connection with the same credentials present on your Salt Edge dashboard
and this synchronization was created with Odoo, you will normally be able to find it by going to
:menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Online Synchronization`. Please make sure to do an
*Update Credentials* to reactivate the connection.
