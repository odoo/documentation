Request a down payment
======================

A down payment is an initial, partial payment, with the agreement that
the rest will be paid later. For expensive orders or projects, it is a
way to protect yourself and make sure your customer is serious.

First time you request a down payment
=====================================

When you confirm a sale, you can create an invoice and select a down
payment option. It can either be a fixed amount or a percentage of the
total amount.

The first time you request a down payment you can select an income
account and a tax setting that will be reused for next down payments.

automatically deducted.
