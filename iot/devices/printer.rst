Connect a Printer
=================

When using your *IoT Box* in Odoo, you could need to use a printer.
Doing so is easy and convenient as it can be done in a few steps. Then,
you can use it to print receipts, orders or even reports in different
Odoo apps.

Connection
==========

The IoT Box supports printers connected through USB, network or Bluetooth.
`Supported printers <https://www.odoo.com/page/iot-hardware>`__ will be
detected automatically and will appear in the *Devices* list of your IoT app.

.. note::
         The printer can take up to two minutes to appear in your devices list.

To Work Orders
--------------

You can link *Work Orders* to printers via a *Quality Control Point*
to print labels for manufactured products.

To do so, you need to create a *Quality Control Point* from the
*Quality* app. Then, you can select the correct manufacturing
operation and the work order operation. In type, choose *Print Label*
and hit save.

downloading a PDF, it will send it to the selected printer and
automatically print it.

Print Receipts from the PoS
---------------------------

You can link a printer to your *Point of Sale* app so you can print
receipts directly from your *PoS*.

Doing so is really easy. Go to your *Point of Sale* app and open your
*Point of Sale* settings, under *Configuration*. There, click on *Edit*
and check the *IoT Box* feature. Then, choose your *Receipt Printer*
from the dropdown.

Now, you will be able to print different kinds of tickets from your *POS*:
**receipts**, **sale details** and **bills**.

Receipts are printed once the order is validated. The process is
automated when you enable the feature in your *PoS* configuration.

Sales details can be printed by clicking on the printer icon on the
navbar at the top of the *PoS*. It will print the details of the sales
of the current day.
