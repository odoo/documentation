Quotations
==========

Here you will find all the quotations sent to you by Odoo. For example, a
quotation can be generated for you after adding an application or a user to your
database or if your contract has to be renewed.

The *Valid Until* column shows the date through which the quotation is valid; after that date,
the quotation will be "Expired". By clicking on the quotation, you will see all
the details of the offer, such as the pricing and other useful information.

modifications, click on "Ask Changes Reject."

.. warning :: At the date of the next invoice, if there is no payment
    information provided or if your credit card has expired, the status of your
    subscription will change to "To Renew".  You will then have 7 days to
    provide a valid method of payment. After this delay, the subscription will
    be closed, and you will no longer be able to access the database.
