A pro-forma invoice is an abridged or estimated invoice in advance of a
delivery of goods. It notes the kind and quantity of goods, their value,
and other important information such as weight and transportation
charges. Pro-forma invoices are commonly used as preliminary invoices
with a quotation, or for customs purposes in importation. They differ
from a normal invoice in not being a demand or request for payment.
