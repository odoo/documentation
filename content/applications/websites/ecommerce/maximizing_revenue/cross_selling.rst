How to sell accessories and optional products (cross-selling)
=============================================================

You sell computers. Why not stimulating your customers to buy a top-notch
screen or an extra-warranty? That's the goal of cross-selling functionalities: 

* Accessory products on checkout page,
* Optional products on a new *Add to Cart* screen (not installed by default).

Accessory products when checking out
====================================

Accessories (e.g. for computers: mouse, keyboard) show up when the customer
reviews the cart before paying.

.. note::
    There is an algorithm to figure out the best accessories to display in case
    several items are added to cart. If any item is the accessory of several products
    added to cart, it is most likely that it will be atop the list of suggested accessories.

Optional products when adding to cart
=====================================

Optional products are directly related to the item added to cart (e.g. for computers:
warranty, OS software, extra components). Whenever the main product is added to cart,
such a new screen pops up as an extra step.

To publish optional products:

* Install *eCommerce Optional Products* addon in *Apps* menu. Remove the default filter to
  search on addons as well, otherwise only main apps show up.

* Select optional items from the *Sales* tab of the product detail form.

    The quantity of optional items added to cart is the same than the main item.
