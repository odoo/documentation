Legal framework for e-invoicing in Argentina
============================================

In Argentina, e-invoicing is regulated by the :abbr:`AFIP (Administración Federal de Ingresos
Públicos)` and is mandatory for most businesses to ensure tax compliance and transparency. The
primary regulations governing e-invoicing include:

- `General Resolution No. 4290/2018 <https://biblioteca.afip.gob.ar/search/query/norma.aspx?p=t:RAG|n:4290|o:3|a:2018|f:02/08/2018>`_
  which establishes the mandatory use of electronic invoices for specific economic activities and
  turnover thresholds.
- Fiscal code regulations: Requires electronic invoices for all VAT-registered businesses, including
  B2B, :abbr:`B2G (business-to-government)`, and B2C transactions.
- Implementation of :abbr:`CAE (Código de Autorización Electrónico)`: Every electronic invoice must
  include a :abbr:`CAE (Código de Autorización Electrónico)` issued by the :abbr:`AFIP
  (Administración Federal de Ingresos Públicos)`, ensuring its validity and authenticity.
