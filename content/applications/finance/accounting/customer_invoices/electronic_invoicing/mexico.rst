Mexico has one of the most advanced e-invoicing systems globally, with electronic invoicing
:abbr:`CFDI (Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet)` being mandatory for most taxpayers. Key
elements include:

-  **CFDI**: A mandatory electronic invoice format for B2B, B2C, and :abbr:`B2G
   (business-to-government)` transactions, fully compliant with SAT requirements.
-  **Digital tax receipt validation**: All :abbr:`CFDIs (Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet)`
   must be digitally signed and validated by :abbr:`SAT (Servicio de Administración
   Tributaria)`-authorized :abbr:`PACs (authorized certification providers)` before issuance.
-  **Complementos**: Specific complements are required for certain transaction types, such as
   payroll or foreign trade.
