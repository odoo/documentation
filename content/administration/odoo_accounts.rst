This documentation is dedicated to edits made to an Odoo.com account. The following processes

Delete Odoo.com account
=======================

To delete an Odoo.com account, start by clicking the profile icon in the upper-right corner
(represented by the username and icon) to reveal a drop-down menu. From the drop-down menu, select
:guilabel:`My Odoo.com account`, which reveals the user portal.

From the user portal, the delete option can be accessed by going to :menuselection:`My Account -->
Edit Security Settings --> Delete Account`. It can also be accessed by going to

   Deleting an Odoo account is irreversible. Be careful performing this action, as the Odoo.com
   account is **not** retrievable once deleted.

Upon clicking the :guilabel:`Delete Account` button, a pop-up window appears, requesting
