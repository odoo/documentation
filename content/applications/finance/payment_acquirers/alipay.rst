Credentials tab
---------------

Odoo needs your **API Credentials** to connect with your Alipay account, which comprise:

- **Account**: Depending on where you are situated
  - `Express Checkout` if your are a Chinese Merchant.
  - `Cross-border` if you are not.
- **Alipay Seller Email**: Your public Alipay partner email (for express checkout only).
- **Merchant Partner ID**: The public partner ID solely used to identify the account with Alipay.
- **MD5 Signature Key**: The signature key.

You can copy your credentials from your Alipay account, and paste them in the related fields under
the **Credentials** tab.

To retrieve them, log into your Alipay account, they are on the front page.

.. important::
   If you are trying Alipay as a test, in the *sandbox*, change the **State** to *Test Mode*. We
   recommend doing this on a test Odoo database, rather than on your main database.
