**Odoo Spreadsheet** allows you to organize, manipulate, analyze, and visualize data. It offers
similar functionality to other spreadsheet solutions with the added benefit of integrating directly
with your Odoo database.

With Odoo Spreadsheet, you can:

- :ref:`create spreadsheets <spreadsheet/get-started/create-spreadsheet>` or :ref:`upload files
  <spreadsheet/get-started/upload-files>` and open them as Odoo spreadsheets
- :ref:`create and use templates <spreadsheet/get-started/templates>`
- :doc:`use functions, including Odoo-specific functions <spreadsheet/work_with_data/functions>`
- :doc:`insert and link to Odoo data <spreadsheet/insert>`
- :doc:`create and use dynamic pivot tables <spreadsheet/work_with_data/dynamic_pivot_tables>`
- filter data across multiple Odoo data sources using :doc:`global filters
  <spreadsheet/work_with_data/global_filters>`
- visualize data using :doc:`charts <spreadsheet/visualize_data/charts>` and formatting
- share files internally and externally

The Spreadsheet module is part of **Odoo Documents**.

.. note::
   Odoo spreadsheets serve as the foundation for the :doc:`dashboards available in Odoo Dashboards
   <../../applications/productivity/dashboards>`. On a dashboard, charts and data tables are used to
   display dynamic Odoo data and provide an overview of key business metrics.

   :ref:`Standard, pre-configured dashboards
   <dashboards/consult-dashboards/standard>` can be :ref:`customized
   <build_and_customize_dashboards/customize>` by editing the dashboard's underlying spreadsheet via
   Dashboards. :ref:`Custom dashboards
   <build_and_customize_dashboards/build>` can also be created from scratch, starting from an Odoo
   spreadsheet; any subsequent :ref:`modifications <build_and_customize_dashboards/customize>` are
   performed via Dashboards.
