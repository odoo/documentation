=========================================
Analyze the performance of your purchases
=========================================

If your company regularly purchases products, you have several reasons to track and analyze your
performance. The insights gathered can help you to better forecast and plan your future orders. For
example, you can assess if your business is dependent on particular vendors, and the data can help
you negotiate discounts on prices.

Generate customized reports
===========================

Go to *Reporting* to access the purchase analysis. Simply by accessing the reporting dashboard, you
can get a quick overview of your actual performance. By default, the reporting dashboard displays a
line chart presenting the untaxed amount of your purchase orders per day, and below it, key metrics
and a pivot table.

While the data initially presented is useful, there are several tools and features you can use to
get even more insights on your purchases.

Use filters to select the data you need
---------------------------------------

Odoo offers several default filters you can use and combine by clicking on *Filters*. When you
select one or several filters, Odoo looks for all the orders that match at least one of the filters
you have chosen and populates the chart, key metrics, and pivot table with the data. The
pre-configured filters are:

#. All *Requests for Quotation*

#. All *Purchase Orders*, except canceled ones

#. *Confirmation Date Last Year* includes all orders that were confirmed the previous year,
   canceled purchase orders included

#. *Order Date* includes all orders - request for quotations and purchases orders (canceled ones
   included) - depending on their date of creation

#. *Confirmation Date* includes all confirmed orders, canceled ones included, depending on their
   date of confirmation

.. note::
   When you have to select a period, you can use multiple years, and, with at least one year
   selected, multiple quarters and the three most recent months.

.. tip::
   If you use the *Order Date* or *Confirmation Date* filters, the *Comparison* feature appears next
   to *Filters*. It enables you to compare the period you filtered with the previous one.

Add custom filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Thanks to the 31 filtering options to choose from, the possibilities of your customizing your
dataset are almost limitless. Go to :menuselection:`Filters --> Add Custom Filter`, specify the
condition the filtering option should meet (e.g. *is equal to*, *contains*, etc.), and click on
*Apply*. If you want to select orders matching several conditions simultaneously (*and* operator),
repeat the process to add another custom filter. If you want to use the *or* operator, don't
click on *Apply*, and click on *Add a condition* instead. Once you have added all the desired
filtering options, click on *Apply*.

.. tip::
   To avoid having to recreate custom filters every time, save them by clicking on
   :menuselection:`Favorites --> Save current search --> Save`. The customized search filter can
   then be accessed by clicking on *Favorites* or can even be set as the default filter when you
   open the reporting dashboard.

Measure exactly what you need
-----------------------------

Before selecting what you want to measure, you need to decide whether you prefer using the graph
view or the pivot view. By default, the dashboard presents both views. However, the measures you
select won't be applied to both views. You can access each view separately by clicking on the icons
at the top right of the dashboard.

Visualize your data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can transform the main graph in just a click by selecting one of the three charts: bar, line or
pie. Fourteen different measures are available, but you can only use one at a time. However, you can
group the measure using one or several of the 19 *Groups*.

For bar and line charts, the selected measure is your y-axis, and the first group you select is used
to create the x-axis. Adding more group adds additional lines (line chart) or transforms your bar
chart into a stacked bar chart. For pie charts, the more groups you select, the more slices are
displayed.

Explore your data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The pivot table view enables you to explore your data in great detail. Unlike the graph view, the
pivot table enables you to add several measures at the same time. By clicking on *Measures* or on
the **+** sign in the *Total* column, you can add as many as you want, each assigned to a new
column. By clicking on the **+** sign in the *Total* row, you can add *Groups*. If you click on a
group's **+** sign, you can add a sub-group, and so on.

.. tip::
   You can insert your pivot table's data directly in the Spreadsheet app or export it as an Excel
   file.
