==================
Manage your tables
==================

Restaurants have specific needs that shops don’t have. That’s why
Odoo gives restaurant owners several unique features to help them manage
their business in the best possible way.

Floor and table management, bill splitting, or even the possibility to
print orders from the kitchen, everything is there to help your
business shine and your employees to work efficiently.

Configuration
=============

To activate the bar/restaurant features, go to :menuselection:`Point of
Sale --> Configuration --> Point of Sale` and open your PoS. Now,
select *Is a Bar/Restaurant*.

Transfer customer(s)
====================

If your customers want to move to another table after they already
ordered, use the transfer button. This way, the order is also moved to the new
table.

To do so, select the table your customer is currently on.
