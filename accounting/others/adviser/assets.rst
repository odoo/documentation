Manage your fixed assets
========================

The "Assets" module allows you to keep track of your fixed assets like
machinery, land and building. The module allows you to generate monthly
depreciation entries automatically, get depreciation board, sell or
dispose assets and perform reports on your company assets.

As an example, you may buy a car for $36,000 (gross value) and you plan
to amortize it over 36 months (3 years). Every months (periodicity),
Odoo will create a depreciation entry automatically reducing your assets
value by $1,000 and passing $1,000 as an expense. After 3 years, this
assets accounts for $0 (salvage value) in your balance sheet.

The different types of assets are grouped into "Assets Types" that
describe how to deprecate an asset. Here are two examples of assets
types:

-  Building: 10 years, yearly linear depreciation
-  Car: 5 years, monthly linear depreciation

Configuration
=============

Install the Asset module
------------------------

Start by *installing the Asset module.*

Once the module is installed, you should see two new menus in the
accounting application:

-  :menuselection:`Adviser --> Assets`
-  :menuselection:`Configuration --> Asset Types`

Before registering your first asset, you must :ref:`define your Asset
Types <accounting/adviser/assets_management/defining>`.

.. _accounting/adviser/assets_management/defining:

Defining Asset Types
--------------------

Asset type are used to configure all information about an assets: asset
and deprecation accounts, amortization method, etc. That way, advisers
can configure asset types and users can further record assets without
having to provide any complex accounting information. They just need to
provide an asset type on the supplier bill.

You should create asset types for every group of assets you frequently
buy like "Cars: 5 years", "Computer Hardware: 3 years". For all other
assets, you can create generic asset types. Name them according to the
duration of the asset like "36 Months", "10 Years", ...

To define asset types, go to :menuselection:`Configuration --> Asset
Types`

Create assets manually
======================

To register an asset manually, go to the menu :menuselection:`Adviser
--> Assets`.

   :align: center

Once your asset is created, don't forget to Confirm it. You can also
click on the Compute Depreciation button to check the depreciation board
before confirming the asset.

.. tip::

   if you create asset manually, you still need to create the supplier
   bill for this asset. The asset document will only produce the
   depreciation journal entries, not those related to the supplier
   bill.

Create assets automatically from a supplier bill
================================================

Assets can be automatically created from supplier bills. All you need to
do is to set an asset category on your bill line. When the user will
validate the bill, an asset will be automatically created, using the
information of the supplier bill.

.. image:: media/image09.png

Depending on the information on the asset category, the asset will be
created in draft or directly validated\ *.* It's easier to confirm
assets directly so that you won't forget to confirm it afterwards.
(check the field *Skip Draft State* on *Asset Category)* Generate assets
in draft only when you want your adviser to control all the assets
before posting them to your accounts.

.. tip:: if you put the asset on the product, the asset category will
         automatically be filled in the supplier bill.

How to depreciate an asset?
===========================

Odoo will create depreciation journal entries automatically at the right
date for every confirmed asset. (not the draft ones). You can control in
the depreciation board: a green bullet point means that the journal
entry has been created for this line.

But you can also post journal entries before the expected date by
clicking on the green bullet and forcing the creation of related
depreciation entry.

.. image:: media/image11.png
   :align: center

.. note:: In the Depreciation board, click on the red bullet to post
          the journal entry. Click on the :guilabel:`Items` button on
          the top to see the journal entries which are already posted.

How to modify an existing asset?
================================

-  Click on :guilabel:`Modify Depreciation`
-  Change the number of depreciation

Odoo will automatically recompute a new depreciation board.

How to record the sale or disposal of an asset?
===============================================

If you sell or dispose an asset, you need to deprecate completly this
asset. Click on the button :guilabel:`Sell or Dispose`. This action
will post the full costs of this assets but it will not record the
sales transaction that should be registered through a customer
invoice.

.. todo:: â†’ This has to be changed in Odoo: selling an asset should:

   #. remove all "Red" lines
   #. create a new line that deprecate the whole residual value
