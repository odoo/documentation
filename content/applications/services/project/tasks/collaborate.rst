Collaborate on Tasks
====================

Being able to collaborate virtually but with the same effect as if people were in the same room
increases your productivity. It results in faster execution of processes, brainstorming and decision
made easier while also allowing the support of outside contributions.

Add followers to a project
==========================

| *Edit* the project to add followers.
| Followers are notified of any changes: tasks sliding from one stage to another, conversations
  taking place, etc.

   Following a project automatically makes you a follower of all its tasks.

Add followers to a task
=======================

Within a task, click on the *Followers* icon. Followers get notified of any changes in the task
and can see the task like you do, with the description and the chatter.

Use the pad like a collaborative note
=====================================

| Go to :menuselection:`Project --> Configuration --> Settings --> Collaborative Pads`, then edit
  the *Settings* of the project you would like the feature to work and enable *Use
  Collaborative Pads*.
| Now, you are able to contribute to tasks in real-time, with several users, with an Etherpad
  collaborative note. Every user has his own color and you can replay the whole creation
  of the content.

.. tip::
   Click on the *</>* icon to get the direct URL of the task description: useful if you want to
   share it without adding this person as a follower, or to someone outside of the company.

The Chatter
===========

| *Chatter* is a communication tool that shows the history of a task, including changes and the
  interactions between you and your customers or colleagues.
| To interact with followers, whether there are internal or external, click on *Log a note* and ping
  them using the at symbol (*@*). If you want to send a message/email to all the followers in the
  task, use *Send a message*.
| You can also ping a channel using the hashtag sign (*#*). This way, users can have a channel per
  project team, for example.
