Legal framework for e-invoicing in Peru
=======================================

Peru has mandated electronic invoicing for most taxpayers to enhance tax compliance, reduce fraud,
and improve transparency. Key elements include:

- **Comprobante de Pago Electrónico (CPE)**: A mandatory electronic document required for B2B, B2C,
  and :abbr:`B2G (business-to-government)` transactions, fully compliant with :abbr:`SUNAT
  (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración Tributaria)`'s technical specifications.
- **Integration with SUNAT**: E-invoices must be submitted to :abbr:`SUNAT (Superintendencia
  Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración Tributaria)` for validation and authorization. Upon
  approval, :abbr:`SUNAT (Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administración Tributaria)`
  assigns a unique identification code to the invoice.
- **XML Format**: All electronic invoices must be issued in XML format, ensuring standardization and
  interoperability.
- **Mandatory adoption timeline**: Electronic invoicing is mandatory for most businesses, with
  specific deadlines for smaller entities.
