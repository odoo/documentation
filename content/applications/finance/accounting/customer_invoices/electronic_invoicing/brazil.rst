Odoo electronic invoicing in Brazil
===================================

Odoo Invoicing is your trusted partner for efficient and legally compliant e-invoicing solutions,
tailored to meet Brazil's regulatory standards. While Odoo covers many key legal cases, it is
recommended to verify specific cases with an Odoo advisor to ensure full compliance with the

Legal framework for e-invoicing in Brazil
=========================================

In Brazil, e-invoicing is highly regulated and mandatory for most businesses to ensure tax
compliance and transparency. The key regulations governing e-invoicing, which is supported through
integration with Avalara, include:

- :abbr:`NF-e (Nota Fiscal Eletrônica)`: A mandatory e-invoice for goods and services used in B2B
  transactions.
- :abbr:`NFS-e (Nota Fiscal de Serviços Eletrônica)`: Issued for service-based transactions, with
  implementation varying by municipality.
- :abbr:`NFC-e (Nota Fiscal de Consumidor Eletrônica)`: Used for end consumer transactions.
- Integration with :abbr:`SEFAZ (Secretaria da Fazenda)`: Odoo connects with Avalara to issue the
  electronic invoices, which must be authorized by :abbr:`SEFAZ (Secretaria da Fazenda)` and
  issued with a unique authorization code (Autorização de Uso).
