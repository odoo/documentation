How to be responsive at work thanks to my Odoo inbox
====================================================

Use the **Inbox** in Discuss app to monitor updates and progress 
on everything you do in Odoo. 
Notifications and messages from everything you follow or in
which you are mentioned appear in your inbox.

You can keep an eye on your **Inbox** from any screen.

Marking an item with a check marks the message as **read** and removes it
from your inbox. If you would like to save an item for future reference
or action, mark it with a star to add it to the **Starred** box. You can
star any message or notification in Discuss or any of the item-specific
chatters throughout Odoo to keep tabs on it here.
