What kind of support is included?

- Providing you with relevant material (guidelines, product documentation, etc.)
- Answers to issues that you may encounter in your standard Odoo database (e.g., "I cannot close my
  Point of Sale" or "I cannot find my sales KPIs?")
- Questions related to your account, subscription, or billing
- Bug resolution (blocking issues or unexpected behavior not due to misconfiguration or
  customization)
- Issues that might occur in a test database after upgrading to a newer version

*Odoo Support does not apply changes to your production database without your agreement and gives
you the material and knowledge to do it yourself!*
