- :abbr:`NF-e (Nota Fiscal Eletrônica)`: A mandatory e-invoice for goods and services used in B2B
  and :abbr:`B2G (business-to-government)` transactions.
- :abbr:`CT-e (Conhecimento de Transporte Eletrônico)`: Specific to freight and logistics services.
- :abbr:`NFS-e (Nota Fiscal de Serviços Eletrônica)`: Issued for service-based transactions, with
  implementation varying by municipality.
- Integration with :abbr:`SEFAZ (Secretaria da Fazenda)`: Every electronic invoice must be
  authorized by :abbr:`SEFAZ (Secretaria da Fazenda)` and issued with a unique authorization code
  (Autorização de Uso).
