Credentials tab
---------------

Odoo needs your **API Credentials** to connect with your Stripe account, which comprises:

- :ref:`Publishable Key <stripe/api_keys>`: The key solely used to identify the account with Stripe.
- :ref:`Secret Key <stripe/api_keys>`: The key to sign the merchant account with Stripe.
- :ref:`Webhook Signing Secret <stripe/webhook>`: When you enable your webhook on your Stripe
  account, this signing secret must be set to authenticate the messages sent from Stripe to Odoo.

.. important::
   If you are trying Stripe as a test, in the **test mode**, change the **State** to *Test
   Mode*. We recommend doing this on a test Odoo database, rather than on your main database.

.. _stripe/api_keys:

Publishable and Secret keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To retrieve the publishable and secret keys, follow this `link to your API keys
<https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys>`_, or log into your Stripe dashboard and go to
:menuselection:`Developers --> API Keys --> Standard Keys`.

.. _stripe/webhook:

Webhook Signing Secret
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To retrieve the webhook signing secret, you first need to create a webhook.

To do so, follow this `link to your webhooks <https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks>`_, or log into
your Stripe dashboard and go to :menuselection:`Developers --> Webhooks`. Then, click on **Add
endpoint** in your **Hosted endpoints**. A form opens, where you'll need to add the following data:

- | In the **Endpoint URL**, enter your Odoo database's URL followed by ``/payment/stripe/webhook``.
  | For example: ``https://yourcompany.odoo.com/payment/stripe/webhook``
- At the end of the form, you can **Select events** to listen to. Click on it and, in the
  **Checkout** section, select **checkout.session.completed**.

.. note::
   It is possible to select other events, but they are currently not processed by Odoo.

When you click on **Add endpoint**, your Webhook is configured. You can then click on **reveal** to
display your signing secret.

.. _stripe/local-payment-methods:

Enable local payment methods
----------------------------

Local payment methods are payment methods that are only available for certain merchants and
customers countries and currencies.

Odoo supports the following local payment methods:

- Bancontact
- EPS
- giropay
- iDEAL
- Przelewy24 (P24)

To enable specific local payment methods with Stripe, list them as supported payment icons. To do
so, go to :menuselection:`Payment Acquirers --> Stripe --> Configuration` and add the desired
payment methods in the **Supported Payment Icons** field. If the desired payment method is already
listed, you don't have anything to do. If a payment icon record doesn't exist in the database, its
related payment method is considered enabled with Stripe.
