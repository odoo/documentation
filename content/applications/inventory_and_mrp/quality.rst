Quality

**Odoo Quality** helps you define quality control points to trigger quality checks at specific
inventory operations (receiving and final inspection) or manufacturing operations (in-process
inspection).

You will love organizing your quality alerts in Odoo's clean kanban interface. Drag and drop alerts
to report progress and use visual indicators to focus on critical alerts.
