Google Sign-In Authentication
=============================

The **Google Sign-In Authentication** is a useful function that allows your users to sign in to Odoo
with their Google account.

This is particularly helpful if your organization uses Google Workforce and you want the employees
within your organization to connect to Odoo with their Google Accounts.
