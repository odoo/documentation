Legal framework for electronic signatures in South Africa
=========================================================

In South Africa, electronic signatures are regulated under the `Electronic Communications and
Transactions Act <https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/201409/a25-02.pdf>`_. The law
governs transactions performed through electronic means and the use of digital signatures. The key
points of the law include:

- **Legal recognition**: electronic signatures are legally equivalent to handwritten signatures if
  they meet certain criteria.
- **Reliability and security**: electronic signatures must be created with a secure method that can
  reliably identify the signatory and ensure the integrity of the signed document.
- **Advance electronic signatures**: in some cases, electronic signatures must be certified by an
  electronic signature certification authority.
