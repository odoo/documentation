How to create a contact into Odoo CRM?
======================================

Odoo CRM allows you to manually add contacts into your pipeline. It can
be either a lead or an opportunity.

Activate the lead stage
=======================

By default, the lead stage is not activated in Odoo CRM. To activate it,
go to :menuselection:`Configuration --> Settings`, select the option ""use leads
ifâ€¦** as shown below and click on **Apply**.

This activation will create a new submenu **Leads** under
**Sales** that gives you access to a list of all your leads from
which you will be able to create a new contact.

Create a new lead
=================

Go to :menuselection:`Sales --> Leads` and click the **Create** button.

From the contact form, provide all the details in your possession
(contact name, email, phone, address, etc.) as well as some additional
information in the **Internal notes** field. You can also link the
lead to an existing company by editing the**Customer** field. Click
on save and the contact will be visible as a lead in your pipeline .

.. note::

	your lead can be directly handed over to specific sales team and salesperson
	by clicking on **Convert to Opportunity** on the upper left corner of the screen.

Create a new opportunity
========================

You can also directly add a contact into a specific sales team without
having to convert the lead first. On the Sales module, go to your
dashboard and click on the **Pipeline** button of the desired sales
team. If you don't have any sales team yet, :doc:`you need to create one first <../../salesteam/setup/create_team>`.
Then, click on **Create** and fill in the contact details as shown here
above. By default, the newly created opportunity will appear on the
first stage of your sales pipeline.

Another way to create an opportunity is by adding it directly on a
specific stage. For example, if you have have spoken to Mr. Smith at a
meeting and you want to send him a quotation right away, you can add his
contact details on the fly directly into the **Proposition** stage. From
the Kanban view of your sales team, just click on the **+** icon
at the right of your stage to create the contact. The new opportunity
will then pop up into the corresponding stage and you can then fill in
the contact details by clicking on it.
