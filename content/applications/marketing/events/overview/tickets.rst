Selling Tickets
===============

If you automate processes, you save time. If you give attendees multiple payment options to choose
from, you allow flexibility and open margins for more registrations to happen.

Configuration
=============

| Go to :menuselection:`Configuration --> Settings` and activate *Tickets* and *Online Ticketing*.
| *Tickets* allow tickets to be sold :ref:`events/create_event/through_sales_orders`. *Online
  Ticketing* allows the sale of tickets to happen :ref:`events/create_event/through_the_website`.
