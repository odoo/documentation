.. _argentina/configure-your-company:

Configure your company
----------------------

Once the localization modules are installed, the first step is to set up the company's data. In
addition to the basic information, a key field to fill in is the :guilabel:`AFIP Responsibility
Type`, which represents the fiscal obligation and structure of the company.

.. image:: argentina/select-responsibility-type.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Select AFIP Responsibility Type.

Chart of account
----------------

In Accounting, there are three different :guilabel:`Chart of Accounts` packages to choose from.
They are based on a company's AFIP responsibility type, and consider the difference between
companies that do not require as many accounts as the companies that have more complex fiscal
requirements:

- Monotributista (227 accounts);
- IVA Exento (290 accounts);
- Responsable Inscripto (298 Accounts).

Electronic Invoice Credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Environment
***********

The AFIP infrastructure is replicated in two separate environments, **testing** and **production**.

Testing is provided so that the companies can test their databases until they are ready to move
into the **Production** environment. As these two environments are completely isolated from each
other, the digital certificates of one instance are not valid in the other one.

To select a database environment, go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Settings --> Argentinean
Localization` and choose either :guilabel:`Prueba (Testing)` or :guilabel:`Produccion (Production)`.

.. image:: argentina/select-environment.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Select AFIP database environment: Testing or Production.

AFIP certificates
*****************

The electronic invoice and other AFIP services work with :guilabel:`Web Services (WS)` provided by
the AFIP.

In order to enable communication with the AFIP, the first step is to request a :guilabel:`Digital
Certificate` if you do not have one already.

#. :guilabel:`Generate Certificate Sign Request (Odoo)`. When this option is selected, a file with
   extension `.csr` (certificate signing request) is generated to be used in the AFIP portal to
   request the certificate.

   .. image:: argentina/request-certificate.png
      :alt: Request a certificate.

#. :guilabel:`Generate Certificate (AFIP)`. Access the AFIP portal and follow the instructions
   described in `this document <https://drive.google.com/file/d/17OKX2lNWd1bjUt3NxfqcCKBkBh-Xlpo-/
   view>`_ to get a certificate.

#. :guilabel:`Upload Certificate and Private Key (Odoo)`. Once the certificate is generated, upload
   it to Odoo using the :guilabel:`Pencil` icon next to the field :guilabel:`Certificado` and select
   the corresponding file.

   .. image:: argentina/upload-certificate-private-key.png
      :alt: Upload Certificate and Private Key.

.. tip::
   In case you need to configure the Homologation Certificate, please refer to the AFIP official
   documentation: `Homologation Certificate
   <http://www.afip.gob.ar/ws/documentacion/certificados.asp>`_. Furthermore, Odoo allows the user
   to test electronic invoicing locally without a Homologation Certificate. The following message
   will be in the chatter when testing locally:

   .. image:: argentina/local-testing.png

      :alt: Invoice validated locally because it is in a testing environment without testing
            certificate/keys.

Partner
~~~~~~~

Identification type and VAT
***************************

As part of the Argentinean localization, document types defined by the AFIP are now available in the
**Partner form**. Information is essential for most transactions. There are six
:guilabel:`Identification Types` available by default, as well as 32 inactive types.

.. image:: argentina/identification-types.png
   :align: center
   :alt: A list of AR Localization document types in Odoo, as defined by AFIP.

.. note::
   The complete list of :guilabel:`Identification Types` defined by the AFIP is included in Odoo,
   but only the common ones are active.

AFIP responsibility type
************************

In Argentina, the document type and corresponding transactions associated with customers and
vendors is defined by the AFIP Responsibility type. This field should be defined in the **Partner
form**.

.. image:: argentina/select-afip-responsibility-type.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Select AFIP Responsibility Type.

Taxes
~~~~~

As part of the localization module, the taxes are created automatically with their related
financial account and configuration, e.g., 73 taxes for :guilabel:`Responsable Inscripto`.

.. image:: argentina/automatic-tax-configuration.png
   :align: center
   :alt: A list of AR Localization taxes with financial amount and configuration in Odoo.

Taxes types
***********

Argentina has several tax types, the most common ones are:

- :guilabel:`VAT`: this is the regular VAT and can have various percentages;
- :guilabel:`Perception`: advance payment of a tax that is applied on invoices;
- :guilabel:`Retention`: advance payment of a tax that is applied on payments.

Special taxes
*************

Some Argentinean taxes are not commonly used for all companies, and those less common options are
labeled as inactive in Odoo by default. Before creating a new tax, be sure to check if that tax is
not already included as inactive.

.. image:: argentina/special-inactive-taxes.png
   :align: center
   :alt: A list showing less common Argentinean tax options, which are labeled as inactive in Odoo
         by default.

.. _document-types:

Document types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some Latin American countries, like Argentina, some accounting transactions such as invoices and
vendor bills are classified by document types defined by the governmental fiscal authorities. In
Argentina, the `AFIP <https://www.afip.gob.ar/>`__ is the governmental fiscal authority that
defines such transactions.

The document type is an essential piece of information that needs to be clearly displayed in
printed reports, invoices, and journal entries that list account moves.

Each document type can have a unique sequence per journal where it is assigned. As part of the
localization, the document type includes the country in which the document is applicable (this data
is created automatically when the localization module is installed).

The information required for the :guilabel:`Document Types` is included by default so the user does
not need to fill anything on this view:

.. image:: argentina/default-document-type-info.png
   :align: center
   :alt: A list of document types in Odoo.

.. note::
   There are several :guilabel:`Document Types` types that are inactive by default, but can be
   activated as needed.

Letters
*******

For Argentina, the :guilabel:`Document Types` include a letter that helps indicate the type of
transaction or operation. For example, when an invoice is related to a(n):

- :guilabel:`B2B transaction`, a document type :guilabel:`A` must be used;
- :guilabel:`B2C transaction`, a document type :guilabel:`B` must be used;
- :guilabel:`Exportation Transaction`, a document type :guilabel:`E` must be used.

The documents included in the localization already have the proper letter associated with each
:guilabel:`Document Type`, so there is no further configuration necessary.

.. image:: argentina/document-types-grouped-by-letters.png
   :align: center
   :alt: document types grouped by letters.

Use on invoices
***************

The :guilabel:`Document Type` on each transaction will be determined by:

- The journal entry related to the invoice (if the journal uses documents);
- The onditions applied based on the type of issuer and receiver (e.g., the type of fiscal regime of
  the buyer and the type of fiscal regime of the vendor).

Journals
--------

In the Argentinean localization, the journal can have a different approach depending on its usage
and internal type. To configure journals, go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration -->
Journals`.

For sales and purchase journals, it's possible to activate the option :guilabel:`Use Documents`,
which enables a list of :guilabel:`Document Types` that can be related to the invoices and vendor
bills. For more detail on invoices, please refer to the section :ref:`2.3 document types
<document-types>`.

If the sales or purchase journals do not have the :guilabel:`Use Documents` option activated, they
will not be able to generate fiscal invoices, meaning, their use case will be mostly limited to
monitoring account moves related to internal control processes.

AFIP information (also known as AFIP Point of Sale)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`AFIP POS System` is a field only visible for the **Sales** journals and defines the
type of AFIP POS that will be used to manage the transactions for which the journal is created.

The AFIP POS defines the following:

#. the sequences of document types related to the web service;
#. the structure and data of the electronic invoice file.

.. image:: argentina/sales-journal.png
   :align: center
   :alt: A AFIP POS System field which is available on Sales journals in Odoo.

Web services
************

**Web services** help generate invoices for different purposes. Below are a few options to choose
from:

- :guilabel:`wsfev1: Electronic Invoice`: is the most common service, which is used to generate
  invoices for document types A, B, C, M  with no detail per item;
- :guilabel:`wsbfev1: Electronic Fiscal Bond`: is for those who invoice capital goods and wish to
  access the benefit of the Electronic Tax Bonds granted by the Ministry of Economy. For more
  details go to: `Fiscal Bond
  <https://www.argentina.gob.ar/acceder-un-bono-por-fabricar-bienes-de-capital>`__;
- :guilabel:`wsfexv1: Electronic Exportation Invoice`: is used to generate invoices for
  international customers and transactions that involve exportation processes, the document type
  related is type "E".

.. image:: argentina/web-services.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Web Services.

Here are some useful fields to know when working with web services:

- :guilabel:`AFIP POS Number`: is the number configured in the AFIP to identify the operations
  related to this AFIP POS;
- :guilabel:`AFIP POS Address`: is the field related to the commercial address registered for the
  POS, which is usually the same address as the company. For example, if a company has multiple
  stores (fiscal locations) then the AFIP will require the company to have one AFIP POS per
  location. This location will be printed in the invoice report;
- :guilabel:`Unified Book`: when the AFIP POS System is Preimpresa, then the document types
  (applicable to the journal) with the same letter will share the same sequence. For example:

  - Invoice: FA-A 0001-00000002;
  - Credit Note: NC-A 0001-00000003;
  - Debit Note: ND-A 0001-00000004.

Sequences
~~~~~~~~~

For the first invoice, Odoo synchronizes with the AFIP automatically and displays the last sequence
used.

.. note::
   When creating :guilabel:`Purchase Journals`, it's possible to define whether they are related to
   document types or not. In the case where the option to use documents is selected, there would be
   no need to manually associate the document type sequences, since the document number is provided
   by the vendor.

Usage and testing
=================

Invoice
-------

The information below applies to invoice creation once the partners and journals are created and
properly configured.

Document type assignation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the partner is selected, the :guilabel:`Document Type` field will be filled in automatically
based on the AFIP document type:

- **Invoice for a customer IVA Responsable Inscripto, prefix A** is the type of document that shows
  all the taxes in detail along with the customer's information.

  .. image:: argentina/prefix-a-invoice-for-customer.png
     :alt: Invoice for a customer IVA Responsable Inscripto, prefix A.

- **Invoice for an end customer, prefix B** is the type of document that does not detail the taxes,
  since the taxes are included in the total amount.

  .. image:: argentina/prefix-b-invoice-for-end-customer.png
     :alt: Invoice for an end customer, prefix B.

- **Exportation Invoice, prefix E** is the type of document used when exporting goods that shows
  the incoterm.

  .. image:: argentina/prefix-e-exporation-invoice.png
     :alt: Exportation Invoice, prefix E

Even though some invoices use the same journal, the prefix and sequence are given by the
:guilabel:`Document Type` field.

The most common :guilabel:`Document Type` will be defined automatically for the different
combinations of AFIP responsibility type but it can be updated manually by the user before
confirming the invoice.

Electronic invoice elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using electronic invoices, if all the information is correct then the invoice is posted in the
standard way unless there is an error that needs to be addressed. When error messages pop up, they
indicate both the issue that needs attention along with a proposed solution. If an error persists,
the invoice remains in draft until the issue is resolved.

Once the invoice is posted, the information related to the AFIP validation and status is displayed
in the AFIP tab, including:

- :guilabel:`AFIP Autorisation`: CAE number;
- :guilabel:`Expiration Date`: deadline to deliver the invoice to the customers (normally 10 days
  after the CAE is generated);
- :guilabel:`Result:` indicates if the invoice has been :guilabel:`Aceptado en AFIP` and/or
  :guilabel:`Aceptado con Observaciones`.

.. image:: argentina/afip-status.png
   :align: center
   :alt: AFIP Status.

Invoice taxes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Based on the :guilabel:`AFIP Responsibility type`, the VAT tax can apply differently on the PDF
report:

- :guilabel:`A. Tax excluded`: in this case the taxed amount needs to be clearly identified in the
  report. This condition applies when the customer has the following AFIP Responsibility type of
  **Responsable Inscripto**;

  .. image:: argentina/tax-amount-excluded.png
     :alt: Tax excluded.

- :guilabel:`B. Tax amount included`: this means that the taxed amount is included as part of the
  product price, subtotal, and totals. This condition applies when the customer has the following
  AFIP Responsibility types:

  - IVA Sujeto Exento;
  - Consumidor Final;
  - Responsable Monotributo;
  - IVA liberado.

  .. image:: argentina/tax-amount-included.png
     :align: center
     :alt: Tax amount included.

Special use cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Invoices for services
*********************

For electronic invoices that include :guilabel:`Services`, the AFIP requires to report the service
starting and ending date, this information can be filled in the tab :guilabel:`Other Info`.

.. image:: argentina/invoices-for-services.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Invoices for Services.

If the dates are not selected manually before the invoice is validated, the values will be filled
automatically with the first and last day of the invoice's month.

.. image:: argentina/service-dates.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Service Dates.

Exportation invoices
********************

Invoices related to :guilabel:`Exportation Transactions` require that a journal uses the AFIP POS
System **Expo Voucher - Web Service** so that the proper document type(s) can be associated.

.. image:: argentina/exporation-journal.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Exporation journal.

When the customer selected in the invoice is configured with an AFIP responsibility type
:guilabel:`Cliente / Proveedor del Exterior` - :guilabel:`Ley N° 19.640`, Odoo automatically
assigns the:

- Journal related to the exportation Web Service;
- Exportation document type;
- Fiscal position: Compras/Ventas al exterior;
- Concepto AFIP: Products / Definitive export of goods;
- Exempt Taxes.

.. image:: argentina/export-invoice.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Export invoice fields autofilled in Odoo.

.. note::
   The Exportation Documents require Incoterms to be enabled and configured, which can be found in
   :menuselection:`Other Info --> Accounting`.

.. image:: argentina/export-invoice-incoterm.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Export invoice - Incoterm.

Fiscal bond
***********

The :guilabel:`Electronic Fiscal Bond` is used for those who invoice capital goods and wish to
access the benefit of the Electronic Tax Bonds granted by the Ministry of Economy.

For these transactions, it is important to consider the following requirements:

- Currency (according to the parameter table) and invoice quotation;
- Taxes;
- Zone;
- Detail each item;

  - Code according to the Common Nomenclator of Mercosur (NCM);
  - Complete description;
  - Unit Net Price;
  - Quantity;
  - Unit of measurement;
  - Bonus;
  - VAT rate.

Electronic credit invoice MiPyme (FCE)
**************************************

For SME invoices, there are several document types that are classified as **MiPyME**, which are
also known as **Electronic Credit Invoice** (or **FCE** in Spanish). This classification develops a
mechanism that improves the financing conditions for small and medium-sized businesses, and allows
them to increase their productivity, through the early collection of credits and receivables issued
to their clients and/or vendors.

For these transactions it's important to consider the following requirements:

- specific document types (201, 202, 206, etc);
- the emitter should be eligible by the AFIP to MiPyME transactions;
- the amount should be bigger than 100,000 ARS;
- A bank account type CBU must be related to the emisor, otherwise the invoice cannot be validated,
  having an error message such as the following.

.. image:: argentina/bank-account-relation-error.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Bank account relation error.

To set up the :guilabel:`Transmission Mode`, go to settings and select either :guilabel:`SDC` or
:guilabel:`ADC`.

.. image:: argentina/transmission-mode.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Transmission Mode.

To change the :guilabel:`Transmission Mode` for a specific invoice, go to the :guilabel:`Other Info`
tab and change it before confirming.

.. note::
   Changing the :guilabel:`Transmission Mode` will not change the mode selected in
   :guilabel:`Settings`.

.. image:: argentina/transmission-mode-on-invoice.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Transmission Mode on Invoice.

When creating a :guilabel:`Credit/Debit` note related to a FCE document:

- use the :guilabel:`Credit and Debit Note` buttons, so all the information from the invoice is
  transferred to the new :guilabel:`Credit and Debit Note`;
- the document letter should be the same as than the originator document (either A or B);
- the same currency as the source document must be used. When using a secondary currency there is
  an exchange difference if the currency rate is different between the emission day and the payment
  date. It is possible to create a credit/debit note to decrease/increase the amount to pay in ARS.

.. image:: argentina/credit-debit-notes-button.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Credit & debit notes buttons.

When creating a :guilabel:`Credit Note` we can have two scenarios:

#. the FCE is rejected so the :guilabel:`Credit Note` should have the field :guilabel:`FCE, is
   Cancellation?` as *True*; or;
#. the :guilabel:`Credit Note`, is created to annulate the FCE document, in this case the field
   :guilabel:`FCE, is Cancellation?` must be *empty* (false).

.. image:: argentina/fce-es-cancelation.png
   :align: center
   :alt: FCE: Es Cancelación?

.. _argentina/invoice-printed-report:

Invoice printed report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`PDF Report` related to electronic invoices that have been validated by the AFIP
includes a barcode at the bottom of the format which represents the CAE number. The expiration date
is also displayed as it is a legal requirement.

.. image:: argentina/invoice-printed-report.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Invoice printed report.

Troubleshooting and auditing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For auditing and troubleshooting purposes, it is possible to obtain detailed information of an
invoice number that has been previously sent to the AFIP. To retrieve this information, activate the
:ref:`developer mode <developer-mode>`, then go to the :menuselection:`Accounting` menu and click on
the button :guilabel:`Consult Invoice` button in AFIP.

.. image:: argentina/consult-invoice-in-afip.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Consult invoice in AFIP.

.. image:: argentina/consult-invoice-in-afip-details.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Details of invoice consulted in AFIP.

It is also possible to retrieve the last number used in AFIP for a specific document type and POS
Number as a reference for any possible issues on the sequence synchronization between Odoo and
AFIP.

.. image:: argentina/consult-last-invoice-number.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Consult the last invoice number.

Vendor bills
------------

Based on the purchase journal selected for the vendor bill, the :guilabel:`Document Type` is now a
required field. This value is auto-populated based on the AFIP Responsibility type of Issuer and
Customer, but the value can be changed if necessary.

.. image:: argentina/changing-journal-document-type.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Changing journal and document type.

The :guilabel:`Document Number` field needs to be registered manually and the format will be
validated automatically. However, in case the format is invalid, a user error will be displayed
indicating the correct format that is expected.

.. image:: argentina/vendor-bill-document-number.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Vendor bill document number.

The vendor bill number is structured in the same way as the customer invoices, excepted that the
document sequence is entered by the user using the following format: *Document Prefix - Letter -
Document Number*.

Validate vendor bill number in AFIP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As most companies have internal controls to verify that the vendor bill is related to an AFIP valid
document, an automatic validation can be set in :menuselection:`Accounting --> Settings -->
Argentinean Localization --> Validate document in the AFIP`, considering the following levels:

- :guilabel:`Not available:` the verification is not done (this is the default value);
- :guilabel:`Available:` the verification is done. In case the number is not valid it, only displays
  a warning but still allows the vendor bill to be posted;
- :guilabel:`Required:` the verification is done and it does not allow the user to post the vendor
  bill if the document number is not valid.

.. image:: argentina/verify-vendor-bills.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Verify Vendor Bills validity in AFIP.

Validate vendor bills in Odoo
*****************************

With the vendor validation settings enabled, a new button shows up on the vendor bills inside of
Odoo, labeled :guilabel:`Verify on AFIP`, which is located next to the :guilabel:`AFIP
Authorization code` field.

.. image:: argentina/verify-on-afip.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Verify on AFIP.

In case the vendor bill cannot be validated in AFIP, a value of :guilabel:`Rejected` will be
displayed on the dashboard and the details of the invalidation will be added to the chatter.

.. image:: argentina/afip-auth-rejected.png
   :align: center
   :alt: AFIP authorization Rejected.

Special use cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Untaxed concepts
****************

There are some transactions that include items that are not a part of the VAT base amount, such as
fuel and gasoline invoices.

The vendor bill will be registered using one item for each product that is part of the VAT base
amount, and an additional item to register the amount of the exempt concept.

.. image:: argentina/vat-exempt.png
   :align: center
   :alt: VAT exempt.

Perception taxes
****************

The vendor bill will be registered using one item for each product that is part of the VAT base
amount, and the perception tax can be added in any of the product lines. As a result, there will be
one tax group for the VAT and another for the perception. The perception default value is always
:guilabel:`0.10`.

To edit the VAT perception and set the correct amount, you should use the :guilabel:`Pencil` icon
that is the next to the :guilabel:`Perception` amount. After the VAT perception amount has been set,
the invoice can then be validated.

.. image:: argentina/enter-perception-amount.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Enter the perception amount.

Check management
----------------

To install the *Third Party and Deferred/Electronic Checks Management* module, go to
:menuselection:`Apps` and search for the module by its technical name `l10n_latam_check` and click
the :guilabel:`Activate` button.

.. image:: argentina/l10n-latam-check-module.png
   :align: center
   :alt: l10n_latam_check module.

This module enables the required configuration for journals and payments to:

- Create, manage, and control your different types of checks
- Optimize the management of *own checks* and *third party checks*
- Have an easy and effective way to manage expiration dates from your own and third party checks

Once all the configurations are made for the Argentinian electronic invoice flow, it is also needed
to complete certain configurations for the own checks and the third party checks flows.

Own checks
~~~~~~~~~~

Configure the bank journal used to create your own checks by going to :menuselection:`Accounting -->
Configuration --> Journals`, selecting the bank journal, and opening the :guilabel:`Outgoing
Payments` tab.

- :guilabel:`Checks` should be available as a :guilabel:`Payment Method`. If not, click
  :guilabel:`Add a line` and type `Checks` under :guilabel:`Payment Method` to add them
- Enable the :guilabel:`Use electronic and deferred checks` setting.

.. note::
   This last configuration **disables** the printing ability but enables to:

   - Enter check numbers manually
   - Adds a field to allocate the payment date of the check

.. image:: argentina/bank-journal-conf.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Bank journal configurations.

Management of own checks
************************

Own checks can be created directly from the vendor bill. For this process, click on the
:guilabel:`Register Payment` button.

On the payment registration modal, select the bank journal from which the payment is to be made and
set the :guilabel:`Check Cash-In Date`, and the :guilabel:`Amount`.

.. image:: argentina/payment-popup-vendorbill.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Payment pop-up window with own check options enabled.

.. note::
   To manage current checks, the :guilabel:`Check Cash-In Date` field must be left blank or filled
   in with the current date. To manage deferred checks, the :guilabel:`Check Cash-In Date` must be
   set in the future.

To manage your existing own checks, navigate to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Vendors --> Own
Checks`. This window shows critical information such as the dates when checks need to be paid, the
total quantity of checks, and the total amount paid in checks.

.. image:: argentina/checks-menu-vendorbill.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Own checks menu location.

It is important to note that the list is pre-filtered by checks that are still *not reconciled* with
a bank statement - that were not yet debited from the bank - which can be verified with the
:guilabel:`Is Matched with a Bank Statement` field. If you want to see all of your own checks,
delete the :guilabel:`No Bank Matching` filter by clicking on the :guilabel:`X` symbol.

.. image:: argentina/check-menu-list-vendorbill.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Own checks menu organization and filtering.

Cancel an own check
*******************

To cancel an own check created in Odoo, navigate to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Vendors --> Own
Checks` and select the check to be canceled, then click on the :guilabel:`Void Check` button. This
will break the reconciliation with the vendor bills and the bank statements and leave the check in a
**canceled** state.

.. image:: argentina/empty-check-button.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Empty Check button to cancel Own Checks

Third party checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to register payments using third party checks, two specific journals need to be configured.
To do so, navigate to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals` and create two new
journals:

- `Third Party Checks`
- `Rejected Third Party Checks`

.. note::

The available payment methods are listed in the *payments* tabs:

- For new incoming third party checks, go to :menuselection:`Incoming Payments tab --> Add a line`
  and select :guilabel:`New Third Party Checks`. This method is used to create *new* third party
  checks.
- For incoming and outgoing existing third party checks, go to :menuselection:`Incoming Payments tab
  --> Add a line` and select :guilabel:`Existing Third Party Checks`. Repeat the same step for the
  :guilabel:`Outgoing Payments` tab. This method is used to receive and/or pay vendor bills using
  already *existing* checks, as well as for internal transfers.

.. tip::
   You can delete pre-existing payment methods appearing by default when configuring the third
   party checks journals.

The *Rejected Third Party Checks* journal also needs to be created and/or configured. This journal
is used to manage rejected third party checks and can be utilized to send checks rejected at the
moment of collection or when coming from vendors when rejected.

To create the *Rejected Third Party Checks* journal, click the :guilabel:`New` button and configure
the following:

- Type `Rejected Third Party Checks` as the :guilabel:`Journal Name`

  Third Party Checks`, input a :guilabel:`Short Code` of your choice, and select a
  :guilabel:`Currency`

Use the same payment methods as the *Third Party Checks* journal.

New third party checks
**********************

To register a *new* third party check for a customer invoice, click the :guilabel:`Register Payment`
button. In the pop-up window, you must select :guilabel:`Third Party Checks` as journal for the
payment registration.

Select :guilabel:`New Third Party Checks` as :guilabel:`Payment Method`, and fill in the
:guilabel:`Check Number`, :guilabel:`Payment Date`, and :guilabel:`Check Bank`. Optionally, you can
manually add the :guilabel:`Check Issuer Vat`, but this is automatically filled by the customer's

Existing third party checks
***************************

To pay a vendor bill with an *existing* check, click the :guilabel:`Register Payment` button. In the
pop-up window, you must select :guilabel:`Third Party Checks` as journal for the payment
registration.

Select :guilabel:`Existing Third Party Checks` as :guilabel:`Payment Method`, and select a check
from the :guilabel:`Check` field. The field shows all **available existing checks** to be used as
payment for vendor bills.

   :align: center
   :alt: Payment pop-up window with Existing Third Party Check options enabled.

When an **existing third party check** is used, you can review the operations related to it. For
example, you can see if a third party check made to pay a customer invoice was later used as an
existing third party check to pay a vendor bill.

To do so, either go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Customers --> Third Party Checks` or
:menuselection:`Accounting --> Vendors --> Own Checks` depending on the case, and click on a check.
In the :guilabel:`Check Current Journal` field, click on :guilabel:`=> Check Operations` to bring up
the check's history and movements.

   :alt: Check Operations menu.

The menu also displays critical information related to these operations, such as:

- The :guilabel:`Payment Type`, allowing to classify whether it is a payment *sent* to a vendor or a
  payment *received* from a customer
- The :guilabel:`Journal` in which the check is currently registered
- The **partner** associated with the operation (either customer or vendor).
