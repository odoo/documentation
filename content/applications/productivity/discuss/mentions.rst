How to grab attention of other users in my messages
===================================================

You can **mention** a user in a channel or chatter by typing
**@user-name**. Mentioning a user in the chatter will set them as a
follower of the item (if they are not already) and send a message to
their inbox. The item containing the mention will also be bolded in the
list view. Mentioning a user in a channel will send a message to their
inbox. You cannot mention a user in a channel who is not subscribed to
the channel. Typing **#channel-name** will provide a link to the
mentioned channel in either a chatter or another channel.

Direct messaging a user
=======================

**Direct messages** are private messages viewable only by the sender
and recipient. You can send direct messages to other users from
within the Discuss module by creating a new conversation or
selecting an existing one from the sidebar. Direct messages can be
sent from anywhere in Odoo using the speech bubble icon in the top
bar. The online status of other users is displayed to the left of
their name. A **green dot** indicates that a user is Online, an
**orange dot** that they are Idle, and a **grey dot** that they are
offline.

Desktop notifications from Discuss
==================================

You can choose to see **desktop notifications** when you receive a
new direct message. The notification shows you the sender and a
brief preview of the message contents. These can be configured or
disabled by clicking on the gear icon in the corner of the
notification..
