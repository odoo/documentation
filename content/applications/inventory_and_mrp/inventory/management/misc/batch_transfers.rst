Process Batch Transfers
=======================

Batch picking allows a single picker to handle a batch of orders,
reducing the number of times he must visit the same location. In Odoo,
it means you can regroup several transfers into the same batch
transfer, then process it, either via the barcode application or in the form view.

Create a Batch Transfer
=======================

To activate the batch picking option, go to :menuselection:`Inventory
--> Configuration --> Configuration` and enable *Batch Pickings*.

Then, go to :menuselection:`Inventory --> Operations --> Batch
Transfers` and hit the create button.

Now, determine the batch transfer responsible and the type of transfers
you want to include in the batch. To add the types of transfers, click on *Add a line*.

In the example below, a filter was applied to only see the transfers that are in the *Pick* step.
After that, the different transfers that needed to be included in the batch transfer were selected.

To see the products to pick for the different transfers, click on
*Select*. If *Multi-locations* has been activated, the document also shows the locations they have 
been reserved from.

Create a Batch Transfer from the Transfers List View
====================================================

From the *Transfers List View*, select transfers that should be
included in the Batch. Then, select *Add to batch* from the *Action*
list.

Next, determine if you want to add the transfers to an existing draft
batch transfer or create a new one.

Process a Batch Transfer
========================

While gathering the products, you can edit the batch transfer and update
the *Quantity done* for each product. Once everything has been picked, select
*Validate* so the different transfers contained in the batch are validated
too.

In case all the products cannot be picked, you can create backorders for each individual transfer 
which couldnâ€™t be completely processed.

Then, you can enter the batch transfer on which you want to work. Batch
transfers can easily be grouped per responsible if necessary.

In the batch transfer, products are classified per
location. The source document is visible on each line and a color-code
helps differentiate them.
