===========================================
Create Projects and Tasks from Sales Orders
===========================================

When you sell your services, you can choose to automatically have a project/task created, helping
you to not lose track of the work that needs to get done, streamlining the processes between teams.
In addition to that, you are able to invoice or reinvoice clients according to the exact time
spent on that service.

Product set up
==============

| Under :menuselection:`Sales --> Products --> Products` create a new product or set up an existing
  one. Under *General Information* set the *Product Type* as *Service*. Under the *Sales* tab select
  the *Service Invoicing Policy* and *Service Tracking*.
| If you choose to:

| - *Create a task in an existing project*: a task is added in the first column of the selected
   project.
| - *Create a task in sales orderâ€™s project*: a new project for each sales order of that service is
   created based on the template you have chosen.
| - *Create a new project but no task*: only creates a new project, for each time that service is
   sold, based on the skeleton of the project template chosen.

is automatically created.
