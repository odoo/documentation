Outlook Calendar synchronization
================================

Synchronizing a user's *Outlook Calendar* with Odoo is useful for keeping track of tasks and
appointments across all related applications.

   - :doc:`../../general/email_communication/azure_oauth`

Microsoft Azure setup
=====================

To sync the *Outlook Calendar* with Odoo's *Calendar*, a Microsoft *Azure* account is required.
Creating an account is free for users who have never tried, or paid for, *Azure*. For more
information, view the account options on the `Azure website
<https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F>`_.

Refer to `Microsoft's documentation <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/
develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant>`_ on how to set up a Microsoft *Entra ID* (formally called
Microsoft *Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)*). This is an API console to manage and register
Microsoft applications.

Existing Microsoft *Entra ID* users should log in at the `Microsoft Azure developer portal
<https://portal.azure.com/#home>`_. Next, select :guilabel:`View` under the section labeled
:guilabel:`Manage Microsoft Entra ID`.

Register application
--------------------

After logging in with the Microsoft *Entra ID*, `register an application
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app>`_.

To create an application, click :guilabel:`+ Add` in the top menu. From the resulting drop-down
menu, select :guilabel:`App Registration`.

.. image:: outlook/app-register.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Microsoft Azure management page with + Add and App Registration menu highlighted.

Enter a unique :guilabel:`Name` for the connected application.

Choosing the appropriate :guilabel:`Supported account type` is essential, or else the connected
application will not work. Users who wish to connect their *Outlook Calendar* to Odoo should select
the :guilabel:`Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra ID directory -
Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)` option for :guilabel:`Supported
account types`.

When configuring the :guilabel:`Redirect URI`, choose the :guilabel:`Web` option from the first
drop-down menu. Then, enter the Odoo database URI (URL) followed by
`/microsoft_account/authentication`.

.. example::
   Enter `https://yourdbname.odoo.com/microsoft_account/authentication` for the :guilabel:`Redirect
   URI`. Replace `yourdbname.odoo.com` with the :abbr:`URL (Uniform Resource Locator)`.

.. tip::
   Ensure the database's :abbr:`URL (Uniform Resource Locator)` (domain) used in the URI is the
   exact same domain as the one configured on the `web.base.url` system parameter.

   Access the `web.base.url` by activating :ref:`developer mode <developer-mode>`, and navigating to
   :menuselection:`Settings app --> Technical header menu --> Parameters section --> System
   Parameters`. Then, select it from the :guilabel:`Key` list on the :guilabel:`System Parameters`
   page.

For more information on the restrictions and limitations of URIs, check Microsoft's `Redirect URI
(reply URL) restrictions and limitations
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reply-url>`_ page.

Finally, on the application registration page, click :guilabel:`Register` button to complete the
application registration. The :guilabel:`Application (client) ID` is produced. Copy this value, as
it is needed later, in the :ref:`outlook_calendar/odoo_setup`.

.. image:: outlook/app-client-id.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Application client ID highlighted in the essentials section of the newly created
         application.

Create client secret
--------------------

The second credential needed to complete the synchronization of the Microsoft *Outlook Calendar* is
the *Client Secret*. The user **must** add a client secret, as this allows Odoo to authenticate
itself, requiring no interaction from the user's side. *Certificates* are optional.

To add a client secret, click :menuselection:`Certificates & secrets` in the left menu. Then click
:guilabel:`+ New client secret` to create the client secret.

.. image:: outlook/client-secret.png
   :align: center
   :alt: New client secret page with certificates and secrets menu and new client secret option
         highlighted.

Next, type a :guilabel:`Description`, and select when the client secret :guilabel:`Expires`.
Available options include: :guilabel:`90 days (3 months)`, :guilabel:`365 days (12 months)`,
:guilabel:`545 days (18 months)`, :guilabel:`730 days (24 months)` or :guilabel:`Custom`. The
:guilabel:`Custom` option allows the administrator to set a :guilabel:`Start` and :guilabel:`End`
date.

Finally, click :guilabel:`Add` to :guilabel:`Add a client secret`.

.. tip::
   Since resetting the synchronization can be tricky, Odoo recommends setting the maximum allowed
   expiration date for the client secret (24 months or custom), so there is no need to
   re-synchronize soon.

Copy the :guilabel:`Value` for use in the next section.

.. warning::
   Client secret values cannot be viewed, except immediately after creation. Be sure to save the
   secret when created *before* leaving the page.

.. _outlook_calendar/odoo_setup:

Configuration in Odoo
=====================

In the Odoo database, go to :menuselection:`Calendar app --> Configuration --> Settings`, and tick
the checkbox beside the :guilabel:`Outlook Calendar` setting. Remember to click :guilabel:`Save` to
implement the changes.

.. image:: outlook/outlook-calendar-setting.png
   :alt: The "Outlook Calendar" setting activated in Odoo.

From the Microsoft *Azure* portal, under the :guilabel:`Overview` section of the application, copy
the :guilabel:`Application (Client) ID`, if it has not already been copied, and paste it into the
:guilabel:`Client ID` field in Odoo.

.. image:: outlook/client-id.png
   :align: center

Copy the previously-acquired :guilabel:`Value` (Client Secret Value), and paste it into the
:guilabel:`Client Secret` field in Odoo.

.. image:: outlook/client-secret-value.png
   :align: center

Finally, on the Odoo :menuselection:`Settings --> General Settings` page, click :guilabel:`Save`.

.. _outlook/sync:

Sync with Outlook
=================

.. warning::

   Odoo highly recommends testing the Outlook calendar synchronization on a test database and a
   test email address (that is not used for any other purpose) before attempting to sync the
   desired Outlook Calendar with the user's production database.

   If the user has any past, present, or future events on their Odoo calendar before syncing their
   Outlook calendar, Outlook will treat the events pulled from Odoo's calendar during the sync as
   new events, causing an email notification to be sent from Outlook to all the event attendees.

   To avoid unwanted emails being sent to all past, present, and future event attendees, the user
   must add the events from the Odoo calendar to the Outlook calendar before the first ever sync,
   delete the events from Odoo, and then start the sync.

   Even after synchronizing the Odoo Calendar with the Outlook calendar, Outlook will still send a
   notification to all event participants every time an event is edited (created, deleted,
   unarchived, or event date/time changed), with no exceptions. This is a limitation that cannot be
   fixed from Odoo's side.

   In summary, once a user synchronizes their Outlook calendar with the Odoo calendar:

   - Creating an event in Odoo causes Outlook to send an invitation to all event attendees.
   - Deleting an event in Odoo causes Outlook to send a cancellation to all event attendees.
   - Unarchiving an event in Odoo causes Outlook to send an invitation to all event attendees.
   - Archiving an event in Odoo causes Outlook to send a cancellation to all event attendees.
   - Adding a contact to an event causes Outlook to send an invitation to all event attendees.
   - Removing a contact from an event causes Outlook to send a cancellation to all event attendees.

Sync Odoo Calendar and Outlook
------------------------------

In the Odoo database, open to the *Calendar* module, and click the :guilabel:`Outlook` sync button
on the right-side of the page, beneath the monthly calendar.

.. image:: outlook/outlook-sync-button.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The "Outlook" sync button in Odoo Calendar.

The synchronization is a two-way process, meaning that events are reconciled in both accounts
(*Outlook* and Odoo). The page redirects to a Microsoft login page, and the user is asked to log in
to their account, if they are not already. Finally, grant the required permissions by clicking
:guilabel:`Accept`.

.. image:: outlook/accept-terms.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Authentication process on Microsoft Outlook OAuth page.

.. note::
   All users that want to use the synchronization simply need to :ref:`sync their calendar with
   Outlook <outlook/sync>`. The configuration of Microsoft's *Azure* account is only done once, as
   Microsoft *Entra ID* tenants' client IDs and client secrets are unique, and help the user manage
   a specific instance of Microsoft cloud services for internal and external users.

Troubleshoot sync
=================

There may be times when the *Microsoft Outlook Calendar* account does not sync correctly with Odoo.
Sync issues can be seen in the database logs.

In these cases, the account needs troubleshooting. A reset can be performed using the
:guilabel:`Reset Account` button, which can be accessed by navigating to :menuselection:`Settings
app --> Manage Users`. Then, select the user to modify the calendar, and click on the
:guilabel:`Calendar` tab.

.. image:: outlook/outlook-reset.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Reset buttons highlighted on the calendar tab of the user.

Next, click :guilabel:`Reset Account` under the correct calendar.
