Manage lots of identical products
=================================

Lots are useful for products you receive in great quantity and for which
a lot number can help in reporting, quality controls, or any other info.
Lots will help identify a number of pieces having, for instance, a
production fault. It can be useful for a batch production of clothes or
food.

Odoo has the capacity to manage lots, ensuring compliance with the
traceability requirements imposed by the majority of industries.

The double-entry management in Odoo enables you to run very advanced
traceability.

Setting Up
==========

-------------------------

Manage Lots
===========

Receipts
--------

In order to receive a product tracked by lots, you have to specify its
lot numbers. You have several ways of doing so:

1. Manually assign the different lot numbers

2. Copy/paste lot numbers from an Excel file

First, you need to open the detailed operations of your picking.

When opening the detailed operations, you can click on *Add a line*.
Then, you will be able to fill the lot number in. Once done, you can
click on *Add a line* again to register a new lot number.

lines. After that, you will have to manually enter the number of
products that are contained in each one of the lots.

Operation Types
---------------

Of course, you also have the possibility to define how you will manage
lots for each operation type. To do so, open the *Inventory* app and
go to :menuselection:`Configuration --> Operation Types`.

For each type (receipts, internal transfers, deliveries, …), you can
decide if you allow to create new lot numbers or only use existing ones.
By default, the creation of new lots is only allowed at product
reception, and using existing lot numbers isn’t allowed in this
operation. If you have inter-warehouse transfers and track products by
lots, it can be useful to allow using existing lot numbers in receipts
too.

Lots traceability
=================

The lot number given to the products allows you to keep track of where
they were received, put in stock, to whom they were sold and where they
were shipped to.

To track an item, open the *Inventory* module and, in :menuselection:`Master Data -->
Lots/Serial Numbers`, click on the lot number corresponding to your
search.

When you open the *Traceability* information, you see in which
documents the lot number has been used.
