Quotations
==========

Here you will find all the quotations sent to you by Odoo. For example, a
quotation can be generated for you after adding an application or a user to your
database or if your contract has to be renewed.

The *Valid Until* column shows the date through which the quotation is valid; after that date,
the quotation will be "Expired". By clicking on the quotation, you will see all
the details of the offer, such as the pricing and other useful information.

If you want to accept the quotation, just click "Accept & Pay," and the quote
will get confirmed. If you don't want to accept it, or you need to ask for some
modifications, click on "Ask Changes Reject."

Subscriptions

You can access your subscriptions with Odoo from this section. The first page
shows you the subscriptions that you have and their status.

By clicking on the subscription you will access all the details regarding your
plan: the number of applications purchased, the billing information,
and the payment method.

To change the payment method, click on "Change Payment Method" and enter the new
credit card details.

.. warning::
   At the date of the next invoice, if there is no payment information provided or if your credit
   card has expired, the status of your subscription will change to "To Renew". You will then have 7
   days to provide a valid method of payment. After this delay, the subscription will be closed, and
   you will no longer be able to access the database.

unique personalized assistance to help you customize your solution and optimize
