=====================================

Legal framework for electronic signatures in the Philippines
============================================================

In the Philippines, electronic signatures are regulated under the `Republic Act No. 8792
<https://www.bsp.gov.ph/PaymentAndSettlement/RA8792.pdf>`_ and the `Electronic Commerce Act
<https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pnacn440.pdf>`_. The law governs the use of electronic records and
signatures. The key points of the law include:

- **Legal recognition**: electronic signatures are legally equivalent to handwritten signatures if
  they meet certain criteria.
- **Reliability and security**: electronic signatures must be created with a secure method that can
  reliably identify the signatory and ensure the integrity of the signed document.
- **Philippine national public key infrastructure system**: the Philippine government operates an
  official PKI system known as the Philippine National Public Key Infrastructure. This system
  requires subscribers to adhere to specific obligations regarding the custody and proper use of
  digital certificates.
