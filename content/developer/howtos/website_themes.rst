The Odoo Website Builder is an excellent tool for creating a website fully integrated with other
Odoo apps. Using the theme's options and building blocks is easy and allows you to personalize your
web presence the way you want. However, you can take things even further.

In this documentation, you will learn to completely customize your website without touching Odoo's
core files, and this way, preserve the editing options of the Website Builder.

The information compiled in this documentation is based on our past experiences - both failures and
successes. We invite you to use it as a base to build your own website and adapt it to your needs.
