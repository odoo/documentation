msgid "In order to re-create relationships between different records, you should use the unique identifier from the original application and map it to the **ID** (External ID) column in Odoo.

#: ../../general/base_import/import_faq.rst:23
msgid "Odoo try to find with some heuristic, based on the first ten lines of the files, the type of field for each columns inside your file. For example if you have a column only containing numbers, only the fields that are of type integer will be displayed for you to choose from. While this behaviour might be good and easy for most cases scenarios, it is also possible that it goes wrong sometimes or that you want to map your column to a field that is not proposed by default."

msgid "Odoo can automatically detect if a column is a date and it will try to guess the date format from a set of most used date format. While this process can work for a lot of simple date format, some exotic date format will not be recognize and it is also possible to have some confusion (day and month inverted as example) as it is difficult to guess correctly which part is the day and which one is the month in a date like '01-03-2016'."
