Connect a Camera
================

When using your *IoT Box* in Odoo, you could need to use a camera. As
it can be done in a few steps, this device is really easy to configure.
Then, you can use it in your manufacturing process and link it to a
control point. Doing so will allow you to take pictures when you reach
the chosen quality control point.

Connection
==========

To connect the camera to the *IoT Box*, simply combine the two by
cable.

.. note::
		In some cases, a serial to USB adapter could be needed.

If your camera is a `*supported
one* <https://www.odoo.com/page/iot-hardware>`__, there is no need to
set up anything as it will be detected as soon as it is connected.

In some cases, you could need to restart the box and download your
cameraâ€™s drivers from the box. To do so, go to your *IoT Box Home
Page* and click on *drivers list*. Then, click on load drivers.

Link a Camera to a Quality Control Point
========================================

With the Manufacturing app
--------------------------

In your *Quality app*, you can setup the device on a *Quality Control
Point*. Go to the *Control Points* menu, under *Quality Control*
and open the control point you want to link with the camera.

Now, you can edit the control point and select the device from the
dropdown list. Now, hit save.

Then, your camera can be used with the picked *Control Point*. During
the manufacturing process, reaching the *Quality Control Point* you
chose before will allow you to take a picture.
