Integrating additional costs to products (landed costs)
=======================================================

The landed cost feature in Odoo allows to include additional costs
(shipment, insurance, customs duties, etc.) into the cost of the
product.

.. note::
         Landed costs can only be applied to products with a FIFO or AVCO costing
         method and an automated inventory valuation (which requires the
         accounting application to be installed).

Configuration
=============

First, you need to go in :menuselection:`Inventory --> Configuration --> Settings` and
activate the landed costs feature. You can also determine the default
journal in which the landed cost accounting entries will be recorded.

Add costs to products
=====================

Receive the vendor bill
-----------------------

Let’s imagine I receive a bill from custom duties for a shipment. I’ll
tick the box *Landed Costs* on the vendor bill line.

.. note::
         The landed cost product must be of type service.

If this product is always a landed cost, you can also define it on the
product and avoid having to tick the box on each vendor bill.

At the top of my vendor bill, I’ll see a button *create landed costs*.
I click on this button and a landed cost is automatically created. I can
now decide on which picking those additional costs should apply.

I can now click on *Compute* and go in the tab *Valuation
Adjustments* to see the impact on my products costs. The last step is
to validate the landed cost.

I can access the journal entry that has been created by the landed cost
by clicking on the journal entry.

.. note::
   You are not forced to start from the vendor bill, you can also go in :menuselection:`Inventory
   --> Operations --> Landed Costs` and directly create the landed cost from there.
