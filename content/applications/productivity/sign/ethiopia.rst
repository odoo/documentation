Legal framework for electronic signatures in Ethiopia
=====================================================

In Ethiopia, electronic signatures are regulated under the `Electronic Signature Proclamation No. 1072/2018 <http://laws.eag.gov.et/Upload/CassationDecisionsDocument/fce05041-f22e-4930-a225-95748dd53c3e.pdf>`_.
The law establishes the legal basis for acknowledging electronic records, contracts, and digital
signatures. The key points of the law include:

- **Legal recognition**: electronic signatures are legally equivalent to handwritten signatures if
  they meet certain criteria.
- **Reliability and security**: electronic signatures must be created with a secure method that can
  reliably identify the signatory and ensure the integrity of the signed document.
- **Certificate electronic signature**: digital signature generated using a digital certificate
  supplied by a qualified provider.
