=================================

Legal framework for electronic signatures in South Korea
========================================================

In South Korea, electronic signatures are regulated under the `Digital Signature Act <https://elaw.klri.re.kr/eng_mobile/viewer.do?hseq=61440&type=part&key=28#:~:text=The%20purpose%20of%20this%20Act,infrastructure%20for%20facilitating%20the%20use>`_
and the `Framework Act on Electronic Documents and Transactions of Korea <https://elaw.klri.re.kr/eng_mobile/viewer.do?hseq=61440&type=part&key=28#:~:text=The%20purpose%20of%20this%20Act,infrastructure%20for%20facilitating%20the%20use>`_.
The law governs transactions performed through electronic means and the use of electronic
signatures. The key points of the law include:

- **Legal recognition**: electronic signatures are legally equivalent to handwritten signatures if
  they meet certain criteria.
- **Reliability and security**: electronic signatures must be created with a secure method that can
  reliably identify the signatory and ensure the integrity of the signed document.
- **Electronic signature certification services**: the law recognizes digital signature certificates
  or “seals” that serve as proof of identity of an individual for a certain purpose that can be used
  in special cases to provide additional security. These certificates are issued by Certification
  Authorities and are required by law for the signature of specific acts.
