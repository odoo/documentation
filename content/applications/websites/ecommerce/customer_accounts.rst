Customer accounts
=================

Using customer accounts for an ecommerce shop enables you to :ref:`manage customers
<ecommerce/customer_accounts/account-creation>`, control access to the :ref:`shop
<ecommerce/customer_accounts/shop-access>`, the :ref:`checkout
<ecommerce/customer_accounts/checkout-access>`, or the :ref:`customer portal <portal/access>`,
and support both B2B and B2C operations.

After logging in, customers can access their :doc:`customer portal <../../general/users/portal>`
by clicking their username in the top-right corner of the screen and selecting :guilabel:`My
Account`. From there, they can view all their documents in one place, such as quotations, orders,
invoices, and more.

   The customer account page can be customized with building blocks and other features through
   the :doc:`website builder <../website/web_design>`.

Customer account creation
=========================

You can choose whether customer accounts and document access are available to everyone or restricted
to invited users only. To do so, go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings`,
then scroll down to the :guilabel:`Privacy` section. Under :guilabel:`Customer Account`, select one
of the following options:

- :guilabel:`On invitation`: Customers can only create an account if the website owner sends them
  an invitation.
- :guilabel:`Free sign up`: Every website visitor can create an account and sign in. They will
  get access to the :doc:`portal <../../general/users/portal>` by default.

To send an email invitation to a customer:

- Go to :menuselection:`Website --> eCommerce --> Customers`.
- Select a customer or click :guilabel:`New` to create one, ensuring an :guilabel:`Email` address
  is set.
- Click the :icon:`fa-cog` :guilabel:`(Actions)` icon next to the record's name at the top-left and
  select :guilabel:`Grant portal access`.
- In the :guilabel:`Portal Access Management` pop-up, click :guilabel:`Grant Access` to send the
  invitation.

.. tip::
   To invite multiple customers at once, switch to the customers :icon:`oi-view-list`
   :guilabel:`List` view, select several customers, click the :icon:`fa-cog` :guilabel:`Actions`
   button, and select :guilabel:`Grant portal access`.

Once done, the customer(s) receive an email confirming their account creation, including
instructions on setting a password and activating their account.

.. note::
   - When selecting the :guilabel:`Free sign up`, a clickable :guilabel:`Don't have an account?`
     link appears under the login form on the website.
   - The :guilabel:`On invitation` option is especially useful for B2B businesses that prefer
     to keep :ref:`prices hidden <ecommerce/prices/hide-prices>` on the website and grant access
     only to invited customers.

.. tip::
   It is possible to configure a website form with a :guilabel:`Create a Customer` :ref:`action
   <website/building_blocks/action>` to automatically create a customer record in the backend when
   filled in.

Access restriction
==================

Once a customer account is created, it is still possible to adjust the access rights
either globally or for individual users:

- :ref:`Revoke access or re-invite a customer <portal/access>`
  using the related buttons in the :guilabel:`Portal Access Management` pop-up.
- Restrict :ref:`access to the shop <ecommerce/customer_accounts/shop-access>`;
- Decide whether customers need to create an account to :ref:`complete the checkout
  <ecommerce/customer_accounts/checkout-access>`.

.. tip::
   It is also possible to define the types of documents customers have access to. To do so, click
   your username in the upper-right corner of the website, select :guilabel:`My Account` and open
   the :doc:`website builder <../website/web_design>`. On the :guilabel:`Customize` tab, enable or
   disable access to specific documents as needed.

.. _ecommerce/customer_accounts/shop-access:

Shop access
-----------

To restrict access to the entire online shop for users who are not logged-in, go to
:menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings`, scroll to :guilabel:`Privacy` and under
:guilabel:`Ecommerce Access`, select :guilabel:`Logged in users`. Select :guilabel:`All users` if
the shop should be visible to every website visitor.

.. tip::
   To restrict access to the shop's pricing, use :ref:`pricelists <ecommerce/prices/pricelists>`
   with :ref:`country groups <ecommerce/prices/country-groups>`.

.. _ecommerce/customer_accounts/checkout-access:

Checkout access
---------------

To allow customers to checkout as guests or force them to sign in/create an account, go to
:menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings`, scroll down to the :guilabel:`Shop -
Checkout Process` section, and configure the :guilabel:`Sign in/up at checkout` setting. The
following options are available:

- :guilabel:`Optional`: Customers can check out as guests and register later via the order
  confirmation email to track their order.
- :guilabel:`Disabled (buy as guest)`: Customers can checkout as guests without creating an account.
- :guilabel:`Mandatory (no guest checkout)`: Customers must sign in or create an account at the
  :ref:`Review Order <ecommerce/checkout/review_order>` step to complete their purchase.

.. note::
   - Settings are specific to each website, allowing you to configure a B2C website with guest
     checkout and a B2B website that requires customers to sign in.
   - To use the :ref:`wishlist <ecommerce/products/wishlists>` feature, customers must
     create an account to save their favorite items for later.

Multi-website account
=====================

When managing multiple websites, it is possible to make customer accounts available across *all*
websites, allowing each customer to use a single account. To do so, go to :menuselection:`Website
--> Configuration --> Settings`, in the :guilabel:`Privacy` section, enable :guilabel:`Shared
Customer Accounts` option.

.. note::
   When operating both B2B and B2C online shops, it's recommended to use separate websites for each
   business model.
