How to setup a new bank account?
================================

In Odoo, you can manage multiple bank accounts. In this page, you will
be guided in the creation, modification or deletion of a bank or a
credit card account.

Edit a bank account
--------------------

To ease the process, a bank account is already there. We suggest you to 
edit it first before filling your own bank information. 

Go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Bank
Accounts` and click on the **Bank** item. Edit it.
