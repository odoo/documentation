Connect a Printer
=================

When using your *IoT Box* in Odoo, you could need to use a printer.
Doing so is easy and convenient as it can be done in a few steps. Then,
you can use it to print receipts, orders or even reports in different
Odoo apps.

Connection
==========

To connect the printer to the *IoT Box*, you just have to combine the
two by cable.

.. note::
         Sometimes, a serial to USB adapter may be needed.

If your printer is a `supported
one <https://www.odoo.com/page/iot-hardware>`__, there is no need to set up anything
because it will be automatically detected as soon as it is connected.

.. note::
         The printer can take up to two minutes to appear in your devices list.

In some cases, you may need to restart the box and download your
printerâ€™s drivers from the box. To do so, go to the *IoT Box Home
Page* and click on *drivers list*. Then, click on load drivers.

Link the Printer
================

To Work Orders
--------------

You can link *Work Orders* to printers via a *Quality Control Point*
to print labels for manufactured products.

To do so, you need to create a *Quality Control Point* from the
*Quality* app. Then, you can select the correct manufacturing
operation and the work order operation. In type, choose *Print Label*
and hit save.

Now, each time you click on *Print* in the control panel, instead of
downloading a PDF, it will send it to the selected printer and
automatically print it.

Print Receipts from the PoS
---------------------------

You can link a printer to your *Point of Sale* app so you can print
receipts directly from your *PoS*.

Doing so is really easy. Go to your *Point of Sale* app and open your
*PoS* settings, under *Configuration*. There, click on *Edit* and
check the *IoT Box* feature. Then, enable the *Receipt Printer*.

Now, on your *PoS* view, you will be able to print different kinds of
tickets: **receipts**, **sale details** and **bills**.

For the receipt, it will be printed once the order is validated. The
process is automated when you enable the feature in your *PoS*.

Sales details can be printed by clicking on the printer icon on the
navbar at the top of the *PoS*. It will print the details of the sales
of the current day.

restaurant settings, activate bills and a *Bill* button will appear in
the left panel. Click on it and it will print the bill.
