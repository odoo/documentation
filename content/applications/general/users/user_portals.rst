.. _user_portals/main:

The user portal is a module available by default in Odoo. Users, both customers and vendors, can be
granted :doc:`access to the portal </applications/general/users/access_rights>` by businesses in
order to view certain documents or information within an Odoo database. For example, some common use
cases for providing portal access include allowing customers and vendors to:

- Follow, view, and pay orders
- Follow, download, or pay invoices, including partial payments and down payments
- Manage payment methods
- Manage subscriptions
- Add, remove, or modify their addresses
- Configure connection parameters between Odoo and 3rd-party services

.. note::
   Portal users only have read/view access, and will **not** be able to edit any documents in the
   database.
