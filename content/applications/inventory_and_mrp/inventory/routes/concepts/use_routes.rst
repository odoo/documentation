Routes and Pull/Push Rules
==========================

In inventory management, the supply chain strategy determines when products should be
purchased/manufactured, delivered to distribution centers, and made available to the retail
channel.

In Odoo, a product's supply chain strategy can be configured using *Routes*, which feature *Pull
and Push Rules*. Once everything is properly configured, the Inventory app can automatically
generate transfers following the configured push/pull rules.

Inside the warehouse
====================

In a generic warehouse, there are receiving docks, a quality control area, storage locations,
picking and packing areas, and shipping docks. All products go through all these locations. As the
products move through the locations, each location triggers the products' specified route and
rules.

In this example, vendor trucks unload pallets of ordered products at the receiving docks. Operators
then scan the products in the receiving area. Depending on the product's route and rules, some of
these products are sent to a quality control area (for example, products that are components used
in the manufacturing process), while others are directly stored in their respective locations.

Here is an example of a fulfillment route. In the morning, items are picked for all the orders
that need to be prepared during the day. These items are picked from storage locations and moved to
the picking area, close to where the orders are packed. Then, the orders are packed in their
respective boxes and conveyors bring them close to the shipping docks, ready to be delivered to
customers.

Pull rules
==========

With *Pull Rules*, a demand for some products triggers procurements, while *Push Rules* are
triggered by products arriving in a specific location.

Pull Rules are used to fulfill a sales order. Odoo generates a need at the *Customer Location* for
each product in the order. Because pull rules are triggered by a need, Odoo looks for a pull
rule defined on the *Customer Location*.

In this case, a "delivery order" pull rule that transfers products from the *Shipping Area* to the
*Customer Location* is found, and a transfer between the two locations is created.

Then, Odoo finds another pull rule that tries to fulfill the need for the *Shipping Area*: the
"packing" rule that transfers products from the *Packing Area* to the *Shipping Area*. Finally,
other pull rules are triggered until a transfer between the *Stock* and the *Picking Area* is
created.

.. note::
   All these product transfers are automatically generated by Odoo based on the pull rules, starting
   from the end (the customer location) and going backward (the stock warehouse). While working, the
   operator processes these transfers in the opposite order: first the picking, then the packing,
   and finally the delivery order.

Push rules
==========

On the other hand, *Push Rules* are much easier to understand. Instead of generating documents
based on needs, they are triggered in real time when products arrive in a specific location. Push
rules basically say: "when a product arrives at a specific location, move it to another location."

An example of a push rule would be: when a product arrives in the *Receipt Area*, move it to the
*Storage Location*. As different push rules can be applied to different products, the user can
assign different storage locations for different products.

Another push rule could be: when products arrive at a location, move them to the *Quality Control
Area*. Then, once the quality check is done, move them to their *Storage Location*.

.. note::
   Push rules can only be triggered if there are no pull rules that have already generated the
   product transfers.

.. important::
   Sets of push/pull rules like those are called *Routes*. The grouping on the rule decides if
   products are grouped in the same transfer or not. For example, during the picking operation, all
   orders and their products are grouped in one transfer, whereas the packing operation respects the
   grouping per customer order.

Use routes and rules
====================

Since *Routes* are a collection of *Push and Pull Rules*, Odoo helps you manage advanced route
configurations such as:

- Manage product manufacturing chains.
- Manage default locations per product.
- Define routes within the stock warehouse according to business needs, such as quality control,
  after-sales services, or supplier returns.
- Help rental management by generating automated return moves for rented products.

To configure a route for a product, first, open the :guilabel:`Inventory` application and go to
:menuselection:`Configuration --> Settings`. Then, in the :guilabel:`Warehouse` section, enable the
:guilabel:`Multi-Step Routes` feature and click :guilabel:`Save`.

.. image:: use_routes/multi-steps-routes-feature.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Activate the Multi-Step Routes feature in Odoo Inventory.

.. note::
   The :guilabel:`Storage Locations` feature is automatically activated with the
   :guilabel:`Multi-Step Routes` feature.

Once this first step is completed, the user can use pre-configured routes that come with Odoo, or
they can create custom routes.

Pre-configured routes
---------------------

To access Odoo's pre-configured routes, go to :menuselection:`Inventory --> Configuration -->
Warehouses`. Then, open a warehouse form. In the :guilabel:`Warehouse Configuration` tab, the user
can view the warehouse's pre-configured routes for :guilabel:`Incoming Shipments` and
:guilabel:`Outgoing Shipments`.

.. image:: use_routes/example-preconfigured-warehouse.png
   :align: center
   :alt: A preconfigured warehouse in Odoo Inventory.

Some more advanced routes, such as pick-pack-ship, are also available. The user can select the
route that best fits their business needs. Once the :guilabel:`Incoming Shipments` and
:guilabel:`Outgoing Shipments` routes are set, head to :menuselection:`Inventory --> Configuration
--> Routes` to see the specific routes that Odoo generated.

.. image:: use_routes/preconfigured-routes.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of all the preconfigured routes Odoo offers.

On the :guilabel:`Routes` page, click on a route to open the route form. In the route form, the
user can view which places the route is :guilabel:`Applicable On`. The user can also set the route
to only apply on a specific :guilabel:`Company`. This is useful for multi-company environments; for
example, a user can have a company and warehouse in Country A and a second company and warehouse in
Country B.

.. image:: use_routes/routes-example.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of a route example applicable on product categories and warehouses.

At the bottom of the route form, the user can view the specific :guilabel:`Rules` for the route.
Each :guilabel:`Rule` has an :guilabel:`Action`, a :guilabel:`Source Location`, and a
:guilabel:`Destination Location`.

.. image:: use_routes/rules-example.png
   :align: center
   :alt: An example of rules with push & pull actions in Odoo Inventory.

Custom Routes
-------------

To create a custom route, go to :menuselection:`Inventory --> Configuration --> Routes`, and click
on :guilabel:`Create`. Next, choose the places where this route can be selected. A route can be
applicable on a combination of places.

.. image:: use_routes/advanced-custom-route.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of a pick-pack-ship route.

Each place has a different behavior, so it is important to tick only the useful ones and adapt each
route accordingly. Then, configure the :guilabel:`Rules` of the route.

If the route is applicable on a product category, the route still needs to be manually set on the
product category form by going to :menuselection:`Inventory --> Configuration --> Product
Categories`. Then, select the product category and open the form. Next, click :guilabel:`Edit` and
under the :guilabel:`Logistics` section, set the :guilabel:`Routes`.

When applying the route on a product category, all the rules configured in the route are applied to
**every** product in the category. This can be helpful if the business uses the dropshipping
process for all the products from the same category.

.. image:: use_routes/routes-logistic-section.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of a route applied to the "all" product category.

The same behavior applies to the warehouses. If the route can apply to :guilabel:`Warehouses`, all
the transfers occurring inside the chosen warehouse that meet the conditions of the route's rules
will then follow that route.

.. image:: use_routes/applicable-on-warehouse.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of the warehouse drop-down menu when selecting applicable on warehouse.

If the route is applicable on :guilabel:`Sales Order Lines`, it is more or less the opposite. The
route must be manually chosen when creating a quotation. This is useful if some products go through
different routes.

Remember to toggle the visibility of the :guilabel:`Route` column on the quotation/sales order.
Then, the route can be chosen on each line of the quotation/sales order.

   :align: center
   :alt: View of the menu allowing to add new lines to sales orders.

Finally, there are routes that can be applied to products. Those work more or less like the product
categories: once selected, the route must be manually set on the product form.

To set a route on a product, go to :menuselection:`Inventory --> Products --> Products` and select
the desired product. Then, go to the :guilabel:`Inventory` tab and under the :guilabel:`Operations`
section, select the :guilabel:`Routes`.

.. image:: use_routes/on-product-route.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of a product form, where the route must be selected.

.. important::
   Rules must be set on the route in order for the route to work.

Rules
~~~~~

The rules are defined on the route form. First, go to :menuselection:`Inventory --> Configuration
--> Routes` and open the desired route form. Next, click :guilabel:`Edit` and in the
:guilabel:`Rules` section, click on :guilabel:`Add a line`.

.. image:: use_routes/add-new-rules.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of the rules menu, where it is possible to add new rules.

The available rules trigger various actions. If Odoo offers *Push* and *Pull* rules, others are
also available. Each rule has an :guilabel:`Action`:

- :guilabel:`Pull From`: this rule is triggered by a need for the product in a specific location.
  The need can come from a sales order being validated or from a manufacturing order requiring a
  specific component. When the need appears in the destination location, Odoo generates a picking to
  fulfill this need.
- :guilabel:`Push To`: this rule is triggered by the arrival of some products in the defined source
  location. In the case of the user moving products to the source location, Odoo generates a picking
  to move those products to the destination location.
- :guilabel:`Pull & Push`: this rule allows the generation of pickings in the two situations
  explained above. This means that when products are required at a specific location, a transfer is
  created from the previous location to fulfill that need. This creates a need in the previous
  location and a rule is triggered to fulfill it. Once the second need is fulfilled, the products
  are pushed to the destination location and all the needs are fulfilled.
- :guilabel:`Buy`: when products are needed at the destination location, a request for quotation is
  created to fulfill the need.
- :guilabel:`Manufacture`: when products are needed in the source location, a manufacturing order
  is created to fulfill the need.

   :align: center
   :alt: Overview of a "Pull From" rule that creates a transfer between the stock and the packing
         zone.

The :guilabel:`Operation Type` must also be defined on the rule. This defines which kind of picking
is created from the rule.

If the rule's :guilabel:`Action` is set to :guilabel:`Pull From` or :guilabel:`Pull & Push`, a
:guilabel:`Supply Method` must be set. The :guilabel:`Supply Method` defines what happens at the
source location:

- :guilabel:`Take From Stock`: the products are taken from the available stock of the source
  location.
- :guilabel:`Trigger Another Rule`: the system tries to find a stock rule to bring the products to
  the source location. The available stock is ignored.
- :guilabel:`Take From Stock, if Unavailable, Trigger Another Rule`: the products are taken from
  the available stock of the source location. If there is no stock available, the system tries to
  find a rule to bring the products to the source location.

In the *Scheduling* section, you can determine how Odoo behaves when one of the chain's pickings is
rescheduled. In case you decide to **Propagate Rescheduling**, the next move is also to be
rescheduled.

If you prefer having the choice to reschedule the next move, you can decide to receive an alert in
the form of a *next activity*.

Sample full route flow
======================

In this example, let's use a custom *Pick - Pack - Ship* route to try a full flow with an advanced
custom route.

First, a quick look at the route's rules and their supply methods. There are three rules, all
:guilabel:`Pull From` rules. The :guilabel:`Supply Methods` for each rule are the following:

- :guilabel:`Take From Stock`: When products are needed in the :guilabel:`WH/Packing Zone`, *picks*
  (internal transfers from :guilabel:`WH/Stock` to :guilabel:`WH/Packing Zone`) are created from
  :guilabel:`WH/Stock` to fulfill the need.
- :guilabel:`Trigger Another Rule`: When products are needed in :guilabel:`WH/Output`, *packs*
  (internal transfers from :guilabel:`WH/Packing Zone` to :guilabel:`WH/Output`) are created from
  :guilabel:`WH/Packing Zone` to fulfill the need.
- :guilabel:`Trigger Another Rule`: When products are needed in :guilabel:`Partner
  Locations/Customers`, *delivery orders* are created from :guilabel:`WH/Output` to fulfill the
  need.

.. image:: use_routes/transfers-overview.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Overview of all the transfers created by the pick - pack - ship route.

This means that, when a customer orders products that have a *pick - pack - ship* route set on it,
a delivery order is created to fulfill the order.

.. image:: use_routes/operations-on-transfers.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of the operations created by a pull from transfer.

.. note::
   If the source document for multiple tranfers is the same sales order, the status is not the same.
   The status will be :guilabel:`Waiting Another Operation` if the previous transfer in the list is
   not done yet.

.. image:: use_routes/waiting-status.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of the transfers' various statuses at the beginning of the process.

To prepare the delivery order, packed products are needed at the output area, so an internal
transfer is requested from the packing zone.

.. image:: use_routes/detailed-operations-2.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of the detailed operations for a transfer between the packing and output zones.

Obviously, the packing zone needs products ready to be packed. So, an internal transfer is
requested to the stock and employees can gather the required products from the warehouse.

.. image:: use_routes/detailed-operations-transfer.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of the detailed operations for a transfer between the stock and packing zones.

As explained in the introduction of the documentation, the last step in the process (for this
route, the delivery order) is the first to be triggered, which then triggers other rules until we
reach the first step in the process (here, the internal transfer from the stock to the packing
area). Now, everything is ready to be processed so the customer can get the ordered items.

In this example, the product is delivered to the customer when all the rules have been triggered and
the transfers are done.
