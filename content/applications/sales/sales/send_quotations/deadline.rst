Use quotations deadline to stimulate your customers
===================================================

When sending quotations, it is important to set a deadline to encourage your customers to act.
Indeed, this will stimulate them because they will be afraid of missing a good deal and it will also
allow you to protect yourself in case you have to fulfill an order at a price that is no longer
profitable for you.
