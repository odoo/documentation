Generate an Unsplash access key
===============================

.. tip::
   **As a SaaS user**, you are ready to use Unsplash. You won't need to follow this guide to set up
   Unsplash information since you will use our own Odoo Unsplash key in a transparent way.

Generate an Unsplash access key for non-Saas users
--------------------------------------------------

- Create an account on `Unsplash.com <https://unsplash.com/join>`_.

  Application**.

- You will be prompted to insert an **Application name** and a **Description**. Please prefix your
  application name by "**Odoo:** " so that Unsplash can recognize it as an Odoo instance. Once done,
  click on **Create application**.

   **As a non-SaaS user**, you won't be able to register for a production Unsplash key and will be
   limited to your test key that has a restriction of 50 Unsplash requests per hour.
