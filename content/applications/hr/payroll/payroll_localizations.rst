Payroll localizations
=====================

Payroll localization refers to the process of adapting payroll systems, policies, and compliance
measures to align with the specific labor laws, tax regulations, and social security requirements
of a particular country or region. This ensures that employee salaries, benefits, deductions, and
contributions are processed accurately and in full compliance with local legal and financial
obligations. Localization also includes integrating country-specific payroll elements such as
statutory benefits, holiday entitlements, termination rules, and reporting requirements, helping
businesses avoid legal risks while ensuring employees receive their correct compensation.
