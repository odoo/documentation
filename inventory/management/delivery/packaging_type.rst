Deliver Products in Packages
============================

In Odoo, you have the possibility to deliver your products in different
packages, depending on the volume and or weight of your products.

Configuration
=============

First, you need to activate the *Delivery Packages* feature in the
*Inventory app > Configuration > Settings*.

Proceed to a Delivery
=====================

Now, you can create a planned delivery with some products in it. You
will have the possibility to create new packages and assign them to the
stock move lines.

Then, you can define the package type from this window. Once the
delivery order is validated, you can retrieve which products have been
included in the package.

Use the Put in Pack button
==========================

Another way to put products in packs is to use the *Put in Pack*
button. It will automatically assign a pack to the number of products
which is set as *Done* and duplicate the stock move line if necessary.

Then, you will be able to update the different packages created this
way, directly via the *Packages* button.
