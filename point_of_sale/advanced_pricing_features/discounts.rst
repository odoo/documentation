Apply Discounts
===============

By offering discounts, you can entice your customers and drastically
increase your revenue. It is vital to offer discounts, whether they are
time-limited, seasonal or manually given.

To manage discounts, Odoo has powerful features that help set up a
pricing strategy tailored to every business.

Apply manual discounts
======================

If you seldom use discounts, applying manual ones might be the easiest
solution for your Point of Sale.

You can either apply a discount on the whole order or on specific
products inside an order.

Apply a discount on a product
-----------------------------

From your PoS session interface, use the *Disc* button.

Then, you can input a discount over the product that is currently
selected.

Apply a global discount
-----------------------

To apply a discount on the whole order, go to :menuselection:`Point of
Sales --> Configuration --> Point of Sale` and select your PoS.

Once on your PoS form, select *Global Discounts*, under the *Pricing* category.

   50% discount on oranges.

Apply time-limited discounts
============================

To activate time-limited discounts, you must activate the *Pricelists*
feature. To do so, go to :menuselection:`Point of Sales -->
Configuration --> Point of Sale` and open your PoS. Then, enable the
pricelist feature.

Once activated, you must choose the pricelists you want to make
available in the PoS and define a default one.

Create a pricelist
------------------

By default, Odoo has a *Public Pricelist* configured. To create more,
go to :menuselection:`Point of Sale --> Products --> Pricelists`. Then
click on create.

When creating a pricelist, you can set several criteria to use a
specific price: period, min. quantity, etc. You can also decide to apply
that pricelist on specific products or on the whole range.
