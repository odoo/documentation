SIX
===

Connecting a SIX payment terminal allows you to offer a fluid payment flow to your customers and
ease the work of your cashiers.

.. warning::
   Even though Worldline has recently acquired SIX Payment Services and both companies use Yomani
   payment terminals, the firmware they run is different. Terminals received from Worldline are
   therefore not compatible with this integration.

Configuration
=============

Install the POS IoT Six module
------------------------------

To activate the POS IoT Six module, go to :guilabel:`Apps`, remove the :guilabel:`Apps` filter, and
search for **POS IoT Six**. This module adds the necessary driver and interface to your database to
detect Six terminals.

.. note::
   This module replaces the **POS Six** module.

Connect an IoT system
---------------------

Connecting a Six payment terminal to Odoo is requires :doc:`using an IoT system
</applications/general/iot>`.

Configure the terminal ID
-------------------------

Navigate to the IoT system's homepage, where you can find the  :guilabel:`Six payment terminal`
field once your database server is connected to the IoT system. Click :guilabel:`Configure`, fill
in the :guilabel:`Terminal ID` field with the ID received from Six, and click :guilabel:`Connect`.
Your Six terminal ID should appear in the :guilabel:`Current Terminal Id` section.

Odoo automatically restarts the IoT system when the Six terminal ID is configured. If your Six
terminal is online, it will be automatically detected and connected to the database. Check the IoT
system's homepage under the :guilabel:`Payments` section to confirm the connection.

:doc:`create the related payment method <../../payment_methods>`. Set the journal type as
:guilabel:`Bank` and select :guilabel:`SIX IOT` in the :guilabel:`Use a Payment Terminal` field.
Then, select your terminal device in the :guilabel:`Payment Terminal Device` field.
