Spanish Chart of Accounts
=========================

In Odoo, there are several Spanish Chart of Accounts that are available by default:

- PGCE PYMEs 2008
- PGCE Completo 2008
- PGCE Entitades

You can choose the one you want by going in :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration`
then choose the package you want in the **Fiscal Localization** section.

Be careful, you can only change the accounting package as long as you have not created any accounting entry.

.. tip::
    When you create a new Odoo Online database, the PGCE PYMEs 2008 is installed by default.

Spanish Accounting Reports
==========================

If the Spanish Accounting Localization is installed, you will have access to accounting reports specific to Spain:

- Balance Sheet
- Tax Report (Modelo 111)
- Tax Report (Modelo 115)
- Tax Report (Modelo 303)
