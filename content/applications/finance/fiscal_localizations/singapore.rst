Add PayNow QR codes to invoices
===============================

PayNow is a payment service platform that allows customers to make instant domestic payments to
individuals and merchants in Singapore dollars via online and mobile banking.

Activate QR codes
-----------------

Go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`. Under the :guilabel:`Customer
Payments` section, activate the :guilabel:`QR Codes` feature.

PayNow bank account configuration
---------------------------------

Go to :menuselection:`Contacts --> Configuration --> Bank Accounts` and select the bank account for
which you want to activate PayNow. Set the :guilabel:`Proxy Type` and fill in the :guilabel:`Proxy
Value` field depending on the type you chose.

.. important::
   - The account holder's country must be set to `Singapore` on its contact form.
   - The account holder's city is mandatory.
   - You could also include the invoice number in the QR code by checking the :guilabel:`Include
     Reference` checkbox.

Ensure that the :guilabel:`Recipient Bank` is the one you configured, as Odoo uses this field to
generate the PayNow QR code.
