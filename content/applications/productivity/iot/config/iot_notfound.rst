IoT Box not found
=================

When using your IoT Box, a common issue you might encounter is that your
box is not found on your database. Fortunately, there are a few easy
steps you can follow to find your IoT box.

HTTPS Issues
============

Your IoT Box is not found? You probably have https issues!

To check it, go to your database and verify if your database address
starts with an https (like https://www.odoo.com). If this is the case,
then you may have problems with your IoT Box image. It should be version
18.12 or later.

If your IoT Box image is from an earlier version, then you will have to
reflash the SD card of your IoT Box to update the image (the latest
image can be found `here <http://nightly/odoo.com>`__).

You can find the documentation about SD card flashing here (`here <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bqKsZhWqMqI4mhv4ltF61M_QPiBCHygYjjvkhsCTdaY/edit>`__).
