How to use my own domain name
=============================

By default, your Odoo Online instance and website have a *.odoo.com* domain name, 
for both the URL and the emails. 
But you can change to a custom one (e.g. www.yourcompany.com).

What is a good domain name
==========================
Your website address is as important to your branding as the name of your 
business or organization, so put some thought into changing it for a proper 
domain. Here are some tips:

- Simple and obvious
- Easy to remember and spell
- The shorter the better
- Avoid special characters
- Aim for a .com and/or your country extension

How to apply my domain name to my Odoo instance
===============================================
First let's authorize the redirection (yourcompany.com -> yourcompany.odoo.com):

* Open your Odoo.com account from your homepage.

.. image:: media/domain_name01.png
    :align: center

* Go to the *Manage Databases* page.

.. image:: media/domain_name02.png
    :align: center

* Click on *Domains* to the right of the database you would like to redirect.

.. image:: media/domain_name03.png
    :align: center

* A database domain prompt will appear. Enter your custom domain 
  (e.g. www.yourcompany.com).


.. image:: media/domain_name04.png
    :align: center

We can now apply the redirection from your domain name's manager account:

* Log in to your account and search for the DNS Zones management page.

* Create a CNAME record *www.yourdomain.com* pointing to *mywebsite.odoo.com*.
  If you want to use the naked domain (e.g. yourdomain.com), you need to redirect 
  *yourdomain.com* to *www.yourdomain.com*.

.. note:: Here are some specific guidelines to create a CNAME record:

How to enable SSL (HTTPS) for my Odoo instance
==============================================

Until recently, Odoo users needed to use a third-party CDN service provider such as CloudFlare to enable SSL.

It is not required anymore: Odoo generates the certificate for you automatically, using integration with `Let's Encrypt Certificate Authority and ACME protocol <https://letsencrypt.org/how-it-works/>`__.
In order to get this, simply add your domain name in your customer portal (a separate certificate is generated for each domain name specified).

.. warning::
  **Please note that the certificate generation may take up to 24h.**

If you already use CloudFlare or a similar service, you can keep using it or simply change for Odoo. The choice is yours.


How to make sure that all my URLs use my custom domain?
=======================================================

To set up the root URL of your website and of all the links sent in emails, you can ask an administrator of your database (any user in the *Settings* group) to perform a login from the login screen. It's as simple as that!

If you want to do it manually, you can go to :menuselection:`Settings --> Technical --> System Parameters` . 
Find the entry called ``web.base.url`` (you can create it if it does not exist) and enter the full URL of your website, like ``https://www.myodoowebsite.com``.

.. warning::
  The URL must include the protocol (``https://`` or ``http://``) and must not end by a slash (``/``).

If you want to block the root URL update when an administrator logs in, you can add a System Parameter called  ``web.base.url.freeze`` with its value set to  ``True``.


My website is indexed twice by Google
=====================================

If you set up a custom domain *mydomain.com* name for *mydatabase.odoo.com*,
Google indexes your website under both names. This is a limitation of the Odoo cloud platforms/
