   :align: center
   :alt: Taxes for Ecuador.

The following options have been automatically configured:

- :guilabel:`Tax Support`: to be configured only in the IVA tax, this option is useful when you
  register purchase withholdings.
- :guilabel:`Code ATS`: to be configured only for income tax withholding codes, it is important when
  you register the withholding.

Review your Document Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some accounting transactions like *Customer Invoices* and *Vendor Bills* are classified by document
types. These are defined by the government fiscal authorities, in this case by the SRI.

Each document type can have a unique sequence per journal where it is assigned. As part of the
localization, the document type includes the country on which the document is applicable; also the
data is created automatically when the localization module is installed.

The information required for the document types is included by default so the user does not need to
fill anything there.

- Choose the SRI Payment Method in each payment method's configuration.
- Customers can manually input their identification type and identification number during the

   :guilabel:`Journal` menu.

Payment providers
*****************

To activate the payment providers that should be used to capture eCommerce payments, navigate to
:menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Payment Providers` section and then click on the
:guilabel:`View other providers` button under the :guilabel:`Activate Payments` heading. From here,

eCommerce workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Identification type and number
******************************

The client who is making a purchase will have the option to indicate their identification type and
number during the checkout process. This information is required to correctly generate the
electronic invoice after the checkout is completed.

.. image:: ecuador/website-checkout-form.png
   :alt: Website checkout form.

.. note::
   Verification is done to ensure the :guilabel:`Identification Number` field is completed and has
   the correct number of digits. For RUC identification, 13 digits are required. For Cédula,
   9 digits are required.

After finishing the checkout process, a confirmed invoice is generated, ready to be sent manually or
asynchronously to the SRI.

Point of Sale electronic invoicing
----------------------------------

Make sure the *Ecuadorian module for Point of Sale* (`l10n_ec_edi_pos`) is :ref:`installed
<l10n_ec/module-installation>` to enable the following features and configurations:

- Choose the SRI payment method in each payment method configuration.
- Manually input the customer's identification type and identification number when creating a
  new contact on *POS*.
- Automatically generate a valid electronic invoice for Ecuador at the end of the checkout process.

Payment method configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To :doc:`create a payment method for a point of sale <../../sales/point_of_sale/payment_methods>`,
go to :menuselection:`Point of Sale --> Configuration --> Payment Methods`. Then, set the
:guilabel:`SRI Payment Method` in the payment method form.

Invoicing flows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Identification type and number
******************************

The POS cashier can :ref:`create a new contact for a customer <pos/customers>` who requests an
invoice from an open POS session.

The *Ecuadorian Module for Point of Sale* adds two new fields to the contact creation form:
:guilabel:`Identification Type` and :guilabel:`Tax ID`.

.. note::
   As the identification number length differs depending on the identification type, Odoo
   automatically checks the :guilabel:`Tax ID` field upon saving the contact form. To manually
   ensure the length is correct, know that the :guilabel:`RUC` and :guilabel:`Citizenship` types
   require 13 and 10 digits, respectively.

Electronic invoice: anonymous end consumer
******************************************

When clients do not request an electronic invoice for their purchase, Odoo automatically sets the
customer as :guilabel:`Consumidor Final` and generates an electronic invoice anyway.

.. note::
   If the client requests a credit note due to a return of this type of purchase, the credit note
   should be made using the client's real contact information. Credit notes cannot be created to
   *Consumidor Final* and can be managed :ref:`directly from the POS session <pos/refund>`.

Electronic invoice: specific customer
*************************************

If a customer requests an invoice for their purchase, it is possible to select or create a contact
with their fiscal information. This ensures the invoice is generated with accurate customer details.

.. note::
   If the client requests a credit note due to a return of this type of purchase, the credit note
   and return process can be managed :ref:`directly from the POS session <pos/refund>`.

Financial reports
=================

In Ecuador, there are fiscal reports that the company presents to SRI. Odoo supports two of the main
financial reports used by companies: **reports 103** and **104**.

To get these reports, go to the **Accounting** app and select :menuselection:`Reporting -->
Statements Reports --> Tax Report` and then filter by `Tax Report 103` or `Tax Report 104`.

Report 103
----------

This report contains information of income tax withholdings in a given period, this can be reported
monthly or semi-annually.

You can see the information needed to report, which includes base and tax amounts, but also includes

ATS report
----------

:ref:`Install <general/install>` the *ATS Report* (`l10n_ec_reports_ats`) module to enable
downloading the ATS report in XML format.

.. note::
   The Ecuadorian *ATS Report* module depends on the previous installation of the *Accounting* app
   and the *Ecuadorian EDI module*.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To issue electronic documents, ensure your company is configured as explained in the
:ref:`electronic invoice <l10n_ec/configure-your-company>` section.

In the :abbr:`ATS (Anexo Transaccional Simplificado)`, every document generated in Odoo (invoices,
vendor bills, sales and purchases withholdings, credit notes, and debit notes) will be included.

Vendor bills
************

When generating a vendor bill, it is necessary to register the authorization number from the
invoice that the vendor generated for the purchase. To do so, go to :menuselection:`Accounting
--> Vendors --> Bills` and select the bill. Then, enter the number from the vendor's invoice in the
:guilabel:`Authorization Number` field.

Credit and debit notes
**********************

When generating a credit note or debit note manually or through importation, it is necessary to link
this note to the sales invoice that is being modified by it.

.. note::
   Remember to add all required information to the documents before downloading the :abbr:`ATS
   (Anexo Transaccional Simplificado)` file. For example, add the *Authorization Number* and the
   *SRI Payment Method* on documents, when needed.

XML generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To generate the :abbr:`ATS (Anexo Transaccional Simplificado)` report, go to
:menuselection:`Accounting --> Reports --> Tax Report` and choose a time period for the desired
:abbr:`ATS (Anexo Transaccional Simplificado)` report, then click :guilabel:`ATS`.
