==================
View architectures
==================

Generic architecture
====================

The architecture of a view is defined by XML data interpreted by the JavaScript framework.

For most views, there is a :file:`\*.rng` file defining the attributes and possible architectures.
Some views are not ruled by such a file either because they accept HTML content, or for performance
reasons.

.. note::
   The current context and user access rights may impact the view abilities.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`view_records`

.. _reference/view_architectures/python_expression:

Python expression
=================

When evaluating node attributes, e.g. the `readonly` modifier, it is possible to provide a **Python
expression** that will be executed in an environment that has access to the following variables:

- The names of all fields present in the current view, containing the value of the current record,
  except for `column_invisible` in :ref:`list view <reference/view_architectures/list/field>`;
  relational fields are given as a list of IDs;
- The ID of the current record;
- `parent`: the record that refers to the container; only inside sub-views of :ref:`relational
  fields <studio/fields/relational-fields>`;
- `context (dict)`: the current view's context;
- `uid (int)`: the id of the current user;
- `today (str)`: the current local date in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format;
- `now (str)`: the current local datetime in the `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss` format.

.. example::
   .. code-block:: xml

      <field name="field_a" readonly="True"/>
      <field name="field_b" invisible="context.get('show_me') and field_a == 4"/>

.. example::
   .. code-block:: xml

      <field name="field_a"/>
      <field name="x2m">
          <!-- sub-view -->
          <form>
              <field name="field_b" invisible="parent.field_a"/>
          </form>
      </field>

.. _reference/view_architectures/form:

Form
====

Form views are used to display the data from a single record. They are composed of regular HTML_
with additional semantic and structural components.

The root element of form views is `form`.

.. code-block:: xml

   <form>
       ...
   </form>

.. _reference/view_architectures/form/root:

Root attributes
---------------

Optional attributes can be added to the root element `form` to customize the view.

.. include:: view_architectures/root_attribute_create.rst

.. include:: view_architectures/root_attribute_edit.rst

.. attribute:: duplicate
   :noindex:

   Disable/enable record duplication on the view through the **Action** dropdown.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: bool
   :default: `True`

.. include:: view_architectures/root_attribute_delete.rst

.. attribute:: js_class
   :noindex:

.. include:: view_architectures/root_attribute_banner_route.rst

.. _reference/view_architectures/form/semantic:

Semantic components
-------------------

Semantic components tie into the Odoo system and allow interaction with it.

Form views accept the following children semantic components: :ref:`field
<reference/view_architectures/form/field>`, :ref:`label <reference/view_architectures/form/label>`,
:ref:`button <reference/view_architectures/form/button>`,
:ref:`reference/view_architectures/form/chatter`, and
:ref:`reference/view_architectures/form/attachment`.

Placeholders are denoted in all caps.

.. _reference/view_architectures/form/field:

`field`: display field values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `field` element renders (and allows editing of, possibly) a single field of the current record.

Using the same field multiple times in a form view is supported, and the fields can receive
different values for the `invisible` and `readonly` attributes. These fields may have the same
values but can be displayed differently. However, the behavior is not guaranteed when several fields
exist with different values for the `required` attribute.

.. code-block:: xml

   <form>
       <field name="FIELD_NAME"/>
   </form>

The `field` element can have the following attributes:

.. include:: view_architectures/field_attribute_name.rst

.. attribute:: id

            </form>
         </field>

.. _reference/view_architectures/form/label:

`label`: display field labels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a :ref:`field <reference/view_architectures/form/field>` component is not placed directly
inside a :ref:`group <reference/view_architectures/form/group>`, or when its `nolabel` attribute is
set, the field's label is not automatically displayed alongside its value. The `label` component is
the manual alternative of displaying the label of a field.

.. code-block:: xml

    <form>
        <div class="col col-md-auto">
            <label for="FIELD_NAME" string="LABEL"/>
            <div>
                <field name="FIELD_NAME" class="oe_inline"/>
            </div>
        </div>
    </form>

The `label` element can have the following attributes:

.. attribute:: for
   :noindex:

   The reference to the field associated with the label. It can be either the name of the field, or
   its id (the `id` attribute set on the :ref:`field <reference/view_architectures/form/field>`).

   When there are several occurrences of the same field in the view, and there are several `label`
   components associated with these field nodes, these labels must have unique `for` attribute; in
   this case, referencing the `id` attribute of the corresponding field nodes.

   :requirement: Mandatory
   :type: str

.. attribute:: string
   :noindex:

   The label to display.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: str
   :default: The field's label coming from the field definition on the model

.. attribute:: confirm
   :noindex:

   The confirmation message to display (and for the user to accept) before performing the button's
   action.

   .. example::
      .. code-block:: xml

         <button name="action_destroye_gate" string="Send the goa'uld" type="object" confirm="Do you confirm the action?"/>

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: str
   :default: `''`

.. attribute:: data-hotkey
   :noindex:

   The hotkey (`keyboard_shortcut`_, similar to an accesskey_) that is bound to the button. It is
   enabled when the `alt` key is pressed together with the selected character, or together with the
   `shift` key and the selected character when `shift+` is prepended to the value.

   .. example::
      .. code-block:: xml

         <button type="object" name="action_confirm" string="Confirm" data-hotkey="c"/>

.. _reference/view_architectures/form/chatter:

Chatter widget
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`chatter widget <reference/mixins/mail/chatter>` is the communication and log tool allowing
to email colleagues and customers directly from a record (task, order, invoice, event, note...).

It is added with a `div` element with the class `oe_chatter` when the model inherits the
`mail.thread` mixin.

.. example::
   .. code-block:: xml

      <form>
          <sheet>
              ...

          <div class="o_attachment_preview"/>
      <form>

.. _reference/view_architectures/form/structural:

Structural components
---------------------

Structural components provide structure or "visual" features with little logic. They are used as
elements or sets of elements in form views.

Form views accept the following children structural components: :ref:`group
<reference/view_architectures/form/group>`, :ref:`sheet <reference/view_architectures/form/sheet>`,
:ref:`notebook <reference/view_architectures/form/notebook>`,
:ref:`notebook <reference/view_architectures/form/notebook>`,

:ref:`separator <reference/view_architectures/form/separator>`,
:ref:`header <reference/view_architectures/form/header>`,
:ref:`footer <reference/view_architectures/form/footer>`,
:ref:`reference/view_architectures/form/button_container`, and
:ref:`reference/view_architectures/form/title_container`.

Placeholders are denoted in all caps.

.. _reference/view_architectures/form/group:

`group`: define columns layouts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `group` element is used to define column layouts in forms. By default, groups define 2 columns,
and most direct children of groups take a single column.

:ref:`field <reference/view_architectures/form/field>` elements that are direct children of groups
display a `label` by default, and the label and the field itself have a `colspan` of `1` each.

Children are laid out horizontally (they try to fill the next column before changing row).

.. code-block:: xml

   <form>
       <group>
           ...
       </group>
  </form>

The `group` element can have the following attributes:

.. attribute:: string
   :noindex:

   The title displayed for the group.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: str
   :default: `''`

.. attribute:: col

             </group>

.. _reference/view_architectures/form/sheet:

`sheet`: make the layout responsive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `sheet` element can be used as a direct child of the :ref:`form
<reference/view_architectures/form>` root element for a narrower and more responsive form layout
(centered page, margin...). It usually contains :ref:`group
<reference/view_architectures/form/group>` elements.

.. code-block:: xml

   <form>
       <sheet>
           ...
       </sheet>
   </form>

.. _reference/view_architectures/form/notebook:

`notebook` & `page`: add tabbed sections

.. _reference/view_architectures/form/newline:

`newline`: start new group rows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `newline` element is used within :ref:`group <reference/view_architectures/form/group>`
elements to end the current row early and immediately switch to a new row, without filling any
remaining column beforehand.

.. code-block:: xml

   <form>
       <group>

   inner `group` element while keeping them horizontally aligned.

.. _reference/view_architectures/form/header:

`header`: display workflow buttons and a status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `header` element combined with the :ref:`sheet <reference/view_architectures/form/sheet>`
element provides a full-width location above the sheet itself generally used to display workflow
:ref:`button <reference/view_architectures/form/button>` elements and a :ref:`field
<reference/view_architectures/form/field>` element rendered as status widget.

.. code-block:: xml

   <form>

Settings
========

Settings views are a customization of the :ref:`form <reference/view_architectures/form>` view. They
are used to display settings in a centralized place. They differ from generic form views in that
they have a search bar and a sidebar.

.. example::

   .. code-block:: xml

      <app string="CRM" name="crm">
          <setting type="header" string="Foo">
              <field name="foo" title="Foo?."/>
              <button name="nameAction" type="object" string="Button"/>
          </setting>
          <block title="Title of group Bar">
              <setting help="this is bar" documentation="/applications/technical/web/settings/this_is_a_test.html">
                  <field name="bar"/>
              </setting>
              <setting string="This is Big BAR" company_specific="1">
                  <field name="bar"/>
              </setting>
          </block>
          <block title="Title of group Foo">
              <setting string="Personalize setting" help="this is full personalize setting">
                  <div>This is a different setting</div>
              </setting>
          </block>
      </app>

.. _reference/view_architectures/settings/components:

Components
----------

Settings views accept the :ref:`field <reference/view_architectures/form/field>`, :ref:`label
<reference/view_architectures/form/label>` and :ref:`button
<reference/view_architectures/form/button>` elements of :ref:`form
<reference/view_architectures/form>` views, as well as three additional children elements:
:ref:`app <reference/view_architectures/settings/app>`, :ref:`block
<reference/view_architectures/settings/block>`, and :ref:`setting
<reference/view_architectures/settings/setting>`.

Placeholders are denoted in all caps.

.. _reference/view_architectures/settings/app:

`app`: declare the application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `app` element is used to declare the application on the settings view. It creates an entry with
the logo of the application on the sidebar of the view. It also acts as delimiter when searching.

.. code-block:: xml

   <form>
       <app string="NAME" name="TECHNICAL_NAME">
       ...
       </app>
   </form>

The `app` element can have the following attributes:

.. attribute:: string
   :noindex:

   The name of the application.

   :requirement: Mandatory
   :type: str

.. attribute:: name
   :noindex:

   The technical name of the application (the name of the module).

   :requirement: Mandatory
   :type: str

.. attribute:: logo
   :noindex:

   The `relative path`_ to the logo.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: path_
   :default: A path computed with the `name` attribute: :file:`/{name}/static/description/icon.png`

.. todo: document attribute notApp

.. include:: view_architectures/generic_attribute_groups.rst

.. include:: view_architectures/generic_attribute_invisible.rst

.. _reference/view_architectures/settings/block:

`block`: declare a group of settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `block` element is used to declare a group of settings. This group can have a title and a
description.

.. code-block:: xml

   <form>
       <app string="NAME" name="TECHNICAL_NAME">
           ...
           <block title="TITLE">
               ...
           </block>
           ...
       </app>
  </form>

The `block` element can have the following attributes:

.. attribute:: title
   :noindex:

   The title of the block of settings. One can search on its value.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: str
   :default: `''`

.. attribute:: help
   :noindex:

   The description of the block of settings. One can search on its value.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: str
   :default: `''`

.. include:: view_architectures/generic_attribute_groups.rst

.. include:: view_architectures/generic_attribute_invisible.rst

.. _reference/view_architectures/settings/setting:

`setting`: declare the setting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `setting` element is used to declare the setting itself.

The first :ref:`field <reference/view_architectures/form/field>` element in the setting is used as
the main field. It is placed on the left panel if it is a boolean field, and on the top of the right
panel otherwise. The field is also used to create the setting label if a `string` attribute is not
defined.

The `setting` element can also contain additional elements (e.g., HTML). All of those elements are
rendered in the right panel.

.. code-block:: xml

   <form>
       <app string="NAME" name="TECHNICAL_NAME">
           <block title="TITLE">
               ...
               <setting string="SETTING_NAME">
                   ...
                   <field name="FIELD_NAME"/>
                   ...
               </setting>
               ...
           </block>
       </app>
   </form>

The `<setting>` element can have the following attributes:

.. attribute:: type
   :noindex:

   By default, a setting is visually separated on two panels (left and right), and is used to edit a
   given :ref:`field <reference/view_architectures/form/field>`. By defining `type="header"`, a
   special kind of setting is rendered instead. This setting is used to modify the scope of the
   other settings. For example, on the Website application, this setting is used to indicate to
   which website the other settings apply. The header setting is visually represented as a banner on
   top of the screen.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: str
   :default: `''`

.. attribute:: string
   :noindex:

   The text used as the label of the setting.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: str
   :default: The first field's label

.. attribute:: title
   :noindex:

   The text used as a tooltip.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: str
   :default: `''`

.. attribute:: help
   :noindex:

   The description of the setting. This text is displayed just below the setting label (with the
   class `text-muted`).

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: str
   :default: `''`

.. attribute:: company_dependent
   :noindex:

   Whether the setting is company-specific. If set, an icon is displayed next to the setting label.

   It accepts only the value `'1'`.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: str
   :default: `''`

.. attribute:: documentation
   :noindex:

   The `path`_ to the documentation on the setting. If set, a clickable icon is displayed next to
   the setting label. The path can be both an absolute or a `relative path`_. In the latter case, it
   is relative to `https://www.odoo.com/documentation/<version>`.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: `path_`
   :default: `''`

Root attributes
---------------

Optional attributes can be added to the root element `tree` to customize the view.

.. include:: view_architectures/root_attribute_string.rst

.. include:: view_architectures/root_attribute_create.rst

.. include:: view_architectures/root_attribute_edit.rst

.. include:: view_architectures/root_attribute_delete.rst

.. attribute:: import
   :noindex:

   Disable/enable record import from data on the view.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: bool
   :default: `True`

.. attribute:: export_xlsx
   :noindex:

   Disable/enable record export to data on the view.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: bool
   :default: `True`

.. attribute:: editable
   :noindex:

   Make the view's records editable in-place, and allow creating new records from a row of the list.
   It can have two different values:

   .. attribute:: top
      :noindex:

      New records are created from the top of the list.

   .. attribute:: bottom
      :noindex:

      New records are created from the bottom of the list.

   The architecture for the inline :ref:`form <reference/view_architectures/form>` view is derived
   from the list view. Most attributes valid on a form view's fields and buttons are thus accepted
   by list views, although they may not have any meaning if the list view is non-editable.

   .. important::
      This behavior is disabled if the `edit` attribute is set to `False`.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: str
   :default: `''`

.. attribute:: multi_edit
   :noindex:

   Activate the multi-editing feature that allows updating a field to the same value for multiple
   records at once.

   It accepts only the value `'1'`.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: str
   :default: `''`

.. attribute:: open_form_view
   :noindex:

   Display a button at the end of each row to open the record in a form view.

   It has no effect if the view is non-editable.

.. attribute:: decoration-<style>
   :noindex:

   The style that should be applied to matching records' rows, as a Python expression that evaluates
   to a bool.

   `<style>` must be replaced by one of `bf` (bold), `it` (italic), `info`, `warning`, `danger`,
   `muted`, `primary`, and `success`.

   .. example::
      .. code-block:: xml

         <tree decoration-danger="field_qty &gt; field_limit">
             ...
         </tree>

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: :ref:`Python expression <reference/view_architectures/python_expression>`
   :default: `False`

.. attribute:: limit
   :noindex:

   The default size of a page. It must be strictly positive.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: int
   :default: `80` for list views, `40` for X2many lists in form views

.. attribute:: groups_limit
   :noindex:

   The default number of groups on a page when the list view is grouped. It must be strictly

<reference/view_architectures/list/button>`, :ref:`groupby
<reference/view_architectures/list/groupby>`, :ref:`header
<reference/view_architectures/list/header>`, :ref:`control, and create
<reference/view_architectures/list/control>`.

Placeholders are denoted in all caps.

.. _reference/view_architectures/list/field:

`field`: display field values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `field` element renders (and allows editing of, possibly) a single field of all current records
as a column.

Using the same field multiple times in a list view is not supported

.. code-block:: xml

   <tree>
       <field name="FIELD_NAME"/>
   </tree>

The `field` element can have the following attributes:

.. include:: view_architectures/field_attribute_name.rst

.. include:: view_architectures/field_attribute_string.rst

.. attribute:: optional
   :noindex:

   Make the visibility of the field optional. The field's column can be hidden or shown through a
   button on the view's header.

   It can have two different values:

   .. attribute:: show
      :noindex:

      The field is shown by default.

   .. attribute:: hide
      :noindex:

      The field is hidden by default.

   .. example::
      .. code-block:: xml

         <field name="fname_a" optional="show"/>
         <field name="fname_b" optional="hide"/>

   The style that should be applied to matching records' field, as a Python expression that
   evaluates to a bool.

   `<style>` must be replaced by one of `bf` (bold), `it` (italic), `info`, `warning`, `danger`,
   `muted`, `primary`, and `success`.

   .. example::
      .. code-block:: xml

         <field name="quantity" decoration-info="state == 'draft'"/>

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: :ref:`Python expression <reference/view_architectures/python_expression>`
   :default: `False`

.. include:: view_architectures/field_attribute_widget.rst

.. attribute:: sum, avg
   :noindex:

   The aggregate to display at the bottom of the column. The aggregation is computed on only
   records that are currently displayed. The aggregation operation must match the corresponding
   field's `group_operator`.

   .. example::
      .. code-block:: xml

         <field name="sent" sum="Total" />
         <field name="clicks_ratio" avg="Average"/>

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: str
   :default: `''`

.. attribute:: width
   :noindex:

   The width to apply to the field's column when there are no records in the list, as an absolute
   width (e.g., `100px`).

   .. important::
      The width is set by the webclient when there are records in the list.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: str
   :default: `''`

.. attribute:: nolabel
   :noindex:

   Whether the field's column header should remain empty. If set, the column will not be sortable.

   It accepts only the value `'1'`

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: str
   :default: `''`

.. note::
   When a list view is grouped, numeric fields are aggregated and displayed for each group. Also, if
   there are too many records in a group, a pager appears on the right of the group row. For this
   reason, it is a bad practice to have a numeric field in the last column when the list view is in
   a situation where it can be grouped. However, it does not pose a problem for X2many fields in a
   form view, as they cannot be grouped.

             </tree>

.. _reference/view_architectures/list/groupby:

`groupby`: define group headers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `groupby` element is used to define group headers with :ref:`button
<reference/view_architectures/list/button>` elements when grouping records on
:attr:`~odoo.fields.Many2one` fields. It also accepts :ref:`field
<reference/view_architectures/list/field>` elements, which can be used for modifiers. These fields
thus belong on the Many2one co-model. These extra fields are fetched in batch.

.. code-block:: xml

   <tree>
       ...
       <groupby name="FIELD_NAME">
           <BUTTONS/>
           <FIELDS/>
       </groupby>
   </tree>

The `groupby` element can have the following attributes:

.. attribute:: name
   :noindex:

   The name of the a :attr:`~odoo.fields.Many2one` field to use as header.

   A special :ref:`button <reference/view_architectures/list/button>` element with `type="edit"` can
   be defined to open the Many2one field's form view.

                 </groupby>
             </tree>

.. note::
   Fields inside the `groupby` element are used only to fetch and store the value, but they are
   never displayed.

.. _reference/view_architectures/list/header:

   <tree>
       <header>
           <BUTTONS/>
       </header>
       ...
   </tree>

The `header` element accepts the following children elements:

.. attribute:: button
   :noindex:

   The `button` element allows defining buttons in the control panel. It is the same element as the
   :ref:`button element in list views <reference/view_architectures/list/button>`, but it accepts
   one more attribute when placed inside a `header` element:

   .. attribute:: display
      :noindex:

      Make the button available at all time, without having to select records.

      It accepts only the value `always`.

      .. example::

         .. code-block:: xml

            <header>
                <button name="toDoAlways" type="object" string="Always displayed" display="always"/>

.. _reference/view_architectures/list/control:

`control` & `create`: add inline create buttons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `control` element defines a control row that accepts create buttons. Each create button is
defined through a `create` element.

.. code-block:: xml

   <tree>
      <control>
          <create string="LABEL"/>
          <BUTTONS/>
       </control>
       ...
   </tree>

The `control` element takes no attributes.

The `create` element can have the following attributes:

.. attribute:: string
   :noindex:

   The button's text.

   :requirement: Mandatory
   :type: str

.. attribute:: context
   :noindex:

   The context that is merged into the view's context when performing the button's call, as a Python
   expression that evaluates to a dict.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: :ref:`Python expression <reference/view_architectures/python_expression>`
   :default: `{}`

                 </control>
             </tree>

.. note::
   Using the `control` element makes sense only if the list view is inside a
   :class:`~odoo.fields.One2many` or :class:`~odoo.fields.Many2many` field. If any `create` element
   is defined, it overwrites the default :guilabel:`add a line` button.

Search
======

Search views are different from other view types in that they are not used to display content.
Although they apply to a specific model, they are used to filter another view's content (usually
aggregated views; e.g., :ref:`reference/view_architectures/list` and
:ref:`reference/view_architectures/graph`).

The root element of search views is `search`.

It takes no attributes.

Components
----------

Search views accept the following children elements: :ref:`field
<reference/view_architectures/search/field>`, :ref:`filter
<reference/view_architectures/search/filter>`, :ref:`separator
<reference/view_architectures/search/separator>`, :ref:`group
<reference/view_architectures/search/group>`, and :ref:`searchpanel
<reference/view_architectures/search/searchpanel>`.

Placeholders are denoted in all caps.

.. _reference/view_architectures/search/field:

`field`: filter based on field values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `field` element defines domains or contexts with user-provided values. When search domains are
generated, field domains are joined with each other and with filters using the **AND** operator.

.. code-block:: xml

   <search>
       <field name="FIELD_NAME"/>
   </search>

The `field` element can have the following attributes:

.. attribute:: name
   :noindex:

   The name of the field to filter on.

   :requirement: Mandatory
   :type: str

.. include:: view_architectures/field_attribute_string.rst

.. attribute:: operator
   :noindex:

   By default, fields generate domains of the form :samp:`[(name, {operator}, value)]`, where `name`
   is the field's name and `value` is the value provided by the user, possibly filtered or
   transformed (e.g., a user is expected to provide the *label* of a selection field's value, not
   the value itself).

   The `operator` attribute allows overriding the default operator, which depends on the field's
   type (e.g., `=` for float fields, but `ilike` for char fields and `child_of` for many2one).

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: str
   :default: `=`

.. attribute:: filter_domain
   :noindex:

   The domain to use as the field's search domain, as a Python expression that evaluates to a
   :ref:`domain <reference/orm/domains>`.

   It  can use the `self` variable to inject the provided value in the custom domain. It can be used
   to generate significantly more flexible domains than with the `operator` attribute alone (e.g.,
   search on multiple fields at once).

   If both the `operator` and `filter_domain` attributes are provided, `filter_domain` takes
   precedence.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: :ref:`Python expression <reference/view_architectures/python_expression>`
   :default: `[]`

.. attribute:: context
   :noindex:

   The context to merge into the context of the view that the search view is targeting, as a Python
   expression that evaluates to a dict.

   It can contain user-provided values, which are available under the `self` variable.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: :ref:`Python expression <reference/view_architectures/python_expression>`
   :default: `{}`

.. attribute:: domain
   :noindex:

   The filters to apply to the completion results for fields that allow for auto-completion (e.g.,
   :class:`~odoo.fields.Many2one`).

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: :ref:`Python expression <reference/view_architectures/python_expression>`

             </search>

.. _reference/view_architectures/search/filter:

`filter`: create pre-defined filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `filter` element is used to create pre-defined filters that can be toggled in the search view.
It allows adding data to the search context :dfn:`the context passed to the data view for
searching/filtering`, or appending new sections to the search filter.

.. code-block:: xml

   <search>
       <filter string="LABEL" domain="DOMAIN"/>
   </search>

The `filter` element can have the following attributes:

.. attribute:: name
   :noindex:

   The technical name of the filter. It can be used to :ref:`enable it by default
   <reference/view_architectures/search/defaults>` or as an :ref:`inheritance hook
   <reference/view_records/inheritance>`.

   :requirement: Mandatory
   :type: str

.. attribute:: string
   :noindex:

   The label of the filter.

   :requirement: Mandatory
   :type: str

.. attribute:: help
   :noindex:

   The tooltip displayed when hovering the filter.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: str
   :default: `''`

.. attribute:: domain
   :noindex:

   The domain to append to the action's domain as part of the search domain.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: :ref:`Python expression <reference/view_architectures/python_expression>`
   :default: `[]`

.. attribute:: date
   :noindex:

   The name of the `date` or `datetime` field to filter on.

   When used, this attribute creates a set of filters available in a sub-menu of the
   :guilabel:`Filters` menu. The available filters are time-dependent but not dynamic in the sense
   that their domains are evaluated at the time of the control panel instantiation.

   .. example::
      .. code-block:: xml

         <filter string="Creation Date" name="filter_create_date" date="create_date"/>

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: str
   :default: `''`

.. attribute:: default_period
   :noindex:

   The default period of the time-based filter (with a `date` attribute). It must be one of, or a
   comma-separated list of, `today`, `this_week`, `this_month`, `last_month`,
   `antepenultimate_month`, `fourth_quarter`, `third_quarter`, `second_quarter`, `first_quarter`,
   `this_year`, `last_year` or `antepenultimate_year`.

   The filter must be in the default set of filters activated at the view initialization.

   .. example::
      .. code-block:: xml

         <filter string="Creation Date" name="filter_create_date" date="create_date" default_period="this_year,last_year"/>

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: str
   :default: `this_month`
   :scope: Filters with a non-empty `date` attribute

.. include:: view_architectures/generic_attribute_invisible.rst

.. include:: view_architectures/generic_attribute_groups.rst

.. attribute:: context
   :noindex:

   The context merged into the action's domain to generate the search domain

   The context key `group_by` set with a field as value can be used to define a group available in
   the :guilabel:`Group By` menu. When the field is of type `date` or `datetime`, the filter
   generates a submenu of the :guilabel:`Group By` menu with the following interval options
   available: :guilabel:`Year`, :guilabel:`Quarter`, :guilabel:`Month`, :guilabel:`Week`, and
   :guilabel:`Day`. When the filter is in the default set of filters activated at the view
   initialization, the records are grouped by month by default. This can be changed by using the
   syntax `date_field:interval`.

   .. example::
      .. code-block:: xml

         <filter string="Category" name="groupby_category" context="{'group_by': 'category_id'}"/>
         <filter string="Creation Date" name="groupby_create_date" context="{'group_by': 'create_date:week'}"/>

   .. note::
      The results of `read_groups` grouped on a field may be influenced by its `group_expand`
      attribute, allowing to display empty groups when needed. For more information, please refer to
      :class:`~odoo.fields.Field`.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: :ref:`Python expression <reference/view_architectures/python_expression>`
   :default: `{}`

.. caution::
   Sequences of filters (without non-filters elements separating them) are treated as inclusively
   composited: they will be composed with `OR` rather than the usual `AND`.

   .. example::
      .. code-block:: xml

         <filter domain="[('state', '=', 'draft')]"/>
         <filter domain="[('state', '=', 'done')]"/>

      Records whose `state` field is `draft` or `done` are shown.

   .. example::
      .. code-block:: xml

         <filter domain="[('state', '=', 'draft')]"/>
         <separator/>
         <filter domain="[('delay', '&lt;', 15)]"/>

      Records whose `state` field is `draft` **and** `delay` field is below 15.

             </search>

.. _reference/view_architectures/search/separator:

`separator`: separate groups of filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `separator` element is used to separates groups of :ref:`filters
<reference/view_architectures/search/filter>` in simple search views. For more complex search views,
the :ref:`group <reference/view_architectures/search/group>` element is recommended.

.. code-block:: xml

   <search>
       <FILTERS/>
       <separator/>
       <FILTERS/>
   </search>

The `separator` element takes no attributes.

.. _reference/view_architectures/search/group:

`group`: separate groups of filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `group` element is used to separate groups of :ref:`filters
<reference/view_architectures/search/filter>` in cluttered search views. In simpler search views, it
can be substituted for the :ref:`separator <reference/view_architectures/search/group>` element.

.. code-block:: xml

   <search>
       <group expand="0" string="LABEL">
           <FILTERS/>
       </group>
   </search>

The `group` element takes no attributes.

.. _reference/view_architectures/search/searchpanel:

`searchpanel`: display search panels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `searchpanel` element displays a search panel to the left of multi-records views. It allows for
quickly filtering data on the basis of given fields.

.. code-block:: xml

   <search>
       <searchpanel>
           <FIELDS/>
       </searchpanel>
   </search>

The `searchpanel` element accepts only `field` children elements.

The `field` element used as a child element of a `searchpanel` element can have the following
attributes:

.. attribute:: name
   :noindex:

   The name of the field to filter on.

   :requirement: Mandatory
   :type: str

.. include:: view_architectures/field_attribute_string.rst

.. attribute:: select
   :noindex:

   The behavior and display of the field. It can have two different values:

   .. attribute:: one
      :noindex:

      At most one value can be selected. Supported field types are `many2one` and `selection`.

   .. attribute:: multi
      :noindex:

      Several values can be selected. Supported field types are `many2one`, `many2many` and
      `selection`.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: str
   :default: `one`

.. include:: view_architectures/generic_attribute_groups.rst

.. attribute:: icon
   :noindex:

   The icon of the field.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: str
   :default: `''`

.. attribute:: color
   :noindex:

   The color of the field.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: str
   :default: `''`

When the `field` element has the `select=one` attribute set, it can have the following additional
attributes:

.. attribute:: hierarchize
   :noindex:

   Whether child categories should appear under their parent category, or at the same hierarchy
   level.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: bool
   :default: `True`
   :scope: :class:`~odoo.fields.Many2one` fields

When the `field` element has the `select=multi` attribute set, it can have the following additional
attributes:

.. attribute:: enable_counters
   :noindex:

   Whether the record counters is computed and displayed if non-zero.

   .. tip::
      This attribute exists to avoid impacting performance. Another way to address performance
      issues is to override the `search_panel_select_range` and `search_panel_select_multi_range`
      methods.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: bool
   :default: `False`

.. attribute:: expand
   :noindex:

   Whether categories and filters with no records should be shown.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: bool
   :default: `False`

.. attribute:: limit
   :noindex:

   The maximal number of values to fetch for the field. If the limit is reached, no values are
   displayed on the search panel, and an error message is shown instead. If set to 0, all values are
   fetched.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: int
   :default: `200`

.. attribute:: domain
   :noindex:

   The conditions that the records have to satisfy.

   .. example::
      .. code-block:: xml

         <searchpanel>
             <field name="department_id"/>
             <field name="manager_id" select="multi" domain="[('department_id', '=', department_id)]"/>
         </searchpanel>

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: :ref:`Python expression <reference/view_architectures/python_expression>`
   :default: `[]`

.. attribute:: groupby
   :noindex:

   The name of the field name on which values should be grouped.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: str
   :default: `''`
   :scope: :class:`~odoo.fields.Many2one` and :class:`~odoo.fields.Many2many` fields

.. _reference/view_architectures/search/defaults:

Search defaults
---------------

Search fields and filters can be configured through the action's `context` using
:samp:`search_default_{name}` keys. For fields, the value must be the value to set to the field. For
filters, it must be a boolean value or a number.

.. example::
   With `foo`, a field, and `bar`, a filter, the following action context will search `foo` on
   `acro` and enable `bar` by default:

   .. code-block:: python

      {
          'search_default_foo': 'acro',
          'search_default_bar': 1
      }

A numeric value (between 1 and 99) can be used to define the order of default *groupby* filters.

.. example::
   With `foo` and `bar`, two *groupby* filters, the following action context will first enable
   `bar`, then `foo`.

   .. code-block:: python

      {
          'search_default_foo': 2,
          'search_default_bar': 1
      }

.. _reference/view_architectures/kanban:

Kanban
======

Kanban views are a used as a `kanban board <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board>`_
visualisation: they display records as "cards", halfway between a :ref:`list
<reference/view_architectures/list>` view and a non-editable :ref:`form
<reference/view_architectures/form>` view.

Records may be grouped in columns for use in workflow visualisation or manipulation (e.g., tasks or
work-progress management), or ungrouped (used simply to visualize records).

The root element of Kanban views is `kanban`.

.. _reference/view_architectures/kanban/header:

`header`: display buttons in the control panel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `header` element is used to insert custom buttons in the control panel.

.. code-block:: xml

   <kanban>
       <header>
           <BUTTONS/>
       </header>
       ...
   </kanban>

The `header` element accepts only `button` children elements, similar to :ref:`list views' button
<reference/view_architectures/list/button>` elements.

The `button` element used as a child element of the `header` element can have the following
additional attributes:

.. attribute:: display
   :noindex:

   The display mode of the button. It can have two different values:

   .. attribute:: display
      :noindex:

      The button is displayed only when some records are selected; their action applies to the
      selected records.


   .. attribute:: always
      :noindex:

      The button is displayed at all times, even if no records are selected.

   .. important::
      Only the `always` display mode is available because it is not yet possible to select records
      in a kanban view.

   .. example::
      .. code-block:: xml

         <header>
             <button name="toDoAlways" type="object" string="Always displayed" display="always"/>
             <button name="toDoSelection" type="object" string="Displayed if selection"/>
         </header>

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: str
   :default: `display`

.. _reference/view_architectures/kanban/progressbar:

`progressbar`: show progress bars on top of columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `progressbar` element is used to define a progress bar to display on top of kanban columns.

.. code-block:: xml

   <kanban>
       <progressbar field="FIELD_NAME"/>
       ...
   </kanban>

The `progressbar` element can have the following attributes:

.. attribute:: field
   :noindex:

   The name of the field on which the progress bar's sub-groups
   are based.

   :requirement: Mandatory
   :type: str

.. attribute:: colors
   :noindex:

   The mapping of the progress bar's field values to the color values `muted`, `success`, `warning`,
   and `danger`.

   :requirement: Mandatory
   :type: `JSON
          <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON>`_

.. attribute:: sum_field
   :noindex:

   The name of the field to use in a sum displayed next to the progress bar. If not set, the total
   number of records is displayed instead.

   :requirement: Optional
   :type: str
   :default: `''`

.. _reference/view_architectures/kanban/templates:

`templates`: define cards structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `templates` elements is used to define the :ref:`QWeb templates <reference/qweb>` that structure
the kanban cards.

Cards structure definition can be split into multiple templates for clarity, but at least one root
template `kanban-box` must be defined.

Two additional templates can be defined: `kanban-menu` and `kanban-tooltip`. If defined, the
`kanban-menu` template is rendered inside a dropdown that can be toggled with a vertical ellipsis
(:guilabel:`⋮`) on the top right of the card. The `kanban-tooltip` template is rendered inside a
tooltip when hovering kanban cards.

The templates are written in :ref:`JavaScript QWeb <reference/qweb/javascript>`

.. code-block:: xml

   <kanban>
       ...
       <templates>
           <t t-name="kanban-box">
               <div>
                   <field name="name"/>
               </div>
           </t>
       </templates>
   </kanban>

The following variables are available in the rendering context:

.. attribute:: widget
   :noindex:

   The current :js:class:`KanbanRecord`. It can be used to fetch some meta-information. The methods
   are also available directly in the template context and don't need to be accessed via `widget`.

   :type: str

.. attribute:: record
   :noindex:

   An object with all the requested fields as its attributes. Each field has two attributes: `value`
   and `raw_value`. The former is formatted according to current user parameters while the latter is
   the raw value from a :meth:`~odoo.models.Model.read` (except for the `date` and `datetime` fields
   that are `formatted according to the user locale <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/a678bd4e
   /addons/web_kanban/static/src/js/kanban_record.js#L102>`_).

   :type: str

.. attribute:: context
   :noindex:

   The current context propagated from either the action that opens the kanban view, or the one2many
   or many2many field that embeds the kanban view in a form view.

   :type: str

.. attribute:: read_only_mode
   :noindex:

   :type: str

.. attribute:: selection_mode
   :noindex:

   Whether the kanban view is opened when selecting a many2one or many2many field in mobile
   environment.

   :type: bool

While most of the kanban templates are standard :ref:`QWeb templates <reference/qweb>`, the kanban
view processes `field`, `button` and `a` elements is a special way:

- By default, fields are replaced by their formatted value, unless the `widget` attribute is
  specified, in which case their rendering and behavior depends on the corresponding widget. The
  `widget` attribute can have different values including:

  .. attribute:: handle
     :noindex:

     Allow reordering records with a drag and drop when their are sorted based on `sequence` (or
     `integer`) fields.

     .. todo:: list all widgets and move the attribute definition in the <field> section

- Buttons and links with a `type` attribute perform different operations than their standard HTML
  function. The `type` attribute can have the values `action` and `object` of :ref:`regular buttons
  <reference/view_architectures/list/button>`, or the following values:

  .. attribute:: open
     :noindex:

     Clicking the element opens the card's record in form view in read-only mode.

  .. attribute:: edit
     :noindex:

     Clicking the element opens the card's record in form view in editable mode.

  .. attribute:: delete
     :noindex:

     Clicking the element deletes the card's record and removes the card.

.. todo::

  - kanban structures/widgets (vignette, details, ...)

.. ALL VIEWS BELOW HAVE NOT YET BEEN CONVERTED TO THE NEW REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION FORMAT

.. _reference/view_architectures/qweb:

QWeb
====

QWeb views are standard :ref:`reference/qweb` templates inside a view's
``arch``. They don't have a specific root element. Because QWeb views don't
have a specific root element, their type must be specified explicitly (it can
not be inferred from the root element of the ``arch`` field).

QWeb views have two use cases:

* they can be used as frontend templates, in which case
  :ref:`reference/data/template` should be used as a shortcut.
* they can be used as actual qweb views (opened inside an action), in which
  case they should be defined as regular view with an explicit ``type`` (it
  can not be inferred) and a model.

The main additions of qweb-as-view to the basic qweb-as-template are:

* qweb-as-view has a special case for a ``<nav>`` element bearing the CSS
  class ``o_qweb_cp_buttons``: its contents should be buttons and will be
  extracted and moved to the control panel's button area, the ``<nav>`` itself
  will be removed, this is a work-around to control panel views not existing
  yet
* qweb-as-view rendering adds several items to the standard qweb rendering
  context:

  .. rst-class:: o-definition-list

  ``model``
    the model to which the qweb view is bound
  ``domain``
    the domain provided by the search view
  ``context``
    the context provided by the search view
  ``records``
    a lazy proxy to ``model.search(domain)``, this can be used if you just
    want to iterate the records and not perform more complex operations
    (e.g. grouping)
* qweb-as-view also provides additional rendering hooks:

  - ``_qweb_prepare_context(view_id, domain)`` prepares the rendering context
    specific to qweb-as-view
  - ``qweb_render_view(view_id, domain)`` is the method called by the client
    and will call the context-preparation methods and ultimately
    ``env['ir.qweb'].render()``.

.. _reference/view_architectures/graph:

Graph
=====

The graph view is used to visualize aggregations over a number of records or
record groups. Its root element is ``<graph>`` which can take the following
attributes:

.. rst-class:: o-definition-list

``type`` (optional)
  one of ``bar`` (default), ``pie`` and ``line``, the type of graph to use

``stacked`` (optional)
  only used for ``bar`` charts. Set to ``0`` to prevent the bars within a group
  to be stacked initially.

``disable_linking`` (optional)
  set to ``1`` to prevent from redirecting clicks on graph to list view

``order`` (optional)
  if set, x-axis values will be sorted by default according their measure with
  respect to the given order (``asc`` or ``desc``). Only used for ``bar`` and
  ``pie`` charts.

``string`` (optional)
  string displayed in the breadcrumbs when redirecting to list view.

.. include:: view_architectures/root_attribute_sample.rst

The only allowed element within a graph view is ``field`` which can have the
following attributes:

.. rst-class:: o-definition-list

``name`` (mandatory)
  the name of a field to use in the view. If used for grouping (rather
  than aggregating)

``invisible`` (optional)
  if true, the field will not appear either in the active measures nor in the
  selectable measures.

``type`` (optional)
  if set to ``measure``, the field will be used as an aggregated value within a
  group instead of a grouping criteria. It only works for the last field
  with that attribute but it is useful for other fields with string attribute
  (see below).

``interval`` (optional)
  on date and datetime fields, groups by the specified interval (``day``,
  ``week``, ``month``, ``quarter`` or ``year``) instead of grouping on the
  specific datetime (fixed second resolution) or date (fixed day resolution).
  Default is ``month``.

``string`` (optional)
  only used for field with ``type="measure"``. The name that will be used to
  display the field in the graph view, overrides the default python String
  attribute of the field.

The measures are automatically generated from the model fields; only the
aggregatable fields are used. Those measures are also alphabetically
sorted on the string of the field.

.. warning::

   graph view aggregations are performed on database content, non-stored
   function fields can not be used in graph views


In Graph views, a ``field`` can have a ``widget`` attribute to dictate its format.
The widget should be a field formatter, of which the most interesting are
``float_time``, and ``monetary``.

.. code-block:: xml

   <field name="working_hours_close" widget="float_time"/>

.. _reference/view_architectures/pivot:

Pivot
=====

The pivot view is used to visualize aggregations as a `pivot table`_. Its root
element is ``<pivot>`` which can take the following attributes:

.. rst-class:: o-definition-list

``disable_linking`` (optional)
  Set to ``1`` to remove table cell's links to list view.
``display_quantity`` (optional)
  Set to ``1`` to display the Quantity column by default.
``default_order`` (optional)
  The name of the measure and the order (asc or desc) to use as default order
  in the view.

  .. code-block:: xml

     <pivot default_order="foo asc">
        <field name="foo" type="measure"/>
     </pivot>

The only allowed element within a pivot view is ``field`` which can have the
following attributes:

.. rst-class:: o-definition-list

``name`` (mandatory)
  the name of a field to use in the view. If used for grouping (rather
  than aggregating)

``string`` (optional)
  the name that will be used to display the field in the pivot view,
  overrides the default python String attribute of the field.

``type`` (optional)
  indicates whether the field should be used as a grouping criteria or as an
  aggregated value within a group. Possible values are:

  .. rst-class:: o-definition-list

  ``row`` (default)
    groups by the specified field, each group gets its own row.
  ``col``
    creates column-wise groups
  ``measure``
    field to aggregate within a group
  ``interval``
    on date and datetime fields, groups by the specified interval (``day``,
    ``week``, ``month``, ``quarter`` or ``year``) instead of grouping on the
    specific datetime (fixed second resolution) or date (fixed day resolution).

``invisible`` (optional)
  if true, the field will not appear either in the active measures nor
  in the selectable measures (useful for fields that do not make sense aggregated,
  such as fields in different units, e.g. € and $).

.. include:: view_architectures/root_attribute_sample.rst

The measures are automatically generated from the model fields; only the
aggregatable fields are used. Those measures are also alphabetically
sorted on the string of the field.

.. warning::

    like the graph view, the pivot aggregates data on database content
    which means that non-stored function fields can not be used in pivot views


In Pivot view a ``field`` can have a ``widget`` attribute to dictate its format.
The widget should be a field formatter, of which the most interesting are
``date``, ``datetime``, ``float_time``, and ``monetary``.

For instance a timesheet pivot view could be defined as::

    <pivot string="Timesheet">
        <field name="employee_id" type="row"/>
        <field name="date" interval="month" type="col"/>
        <field name="unit_amount" type="measure" widget="float_time"/>
    </pivot>

.. _reference/view_architectures/calendar:

Calendar
========

Calendar views display records as events in a daily, weekly, monthly or yearly
calendar.

.. note:: By default the calendar view will be centered around the current date
   (today). You can pass a specific initial date to the context of the action in
   order to set the initial focus of the calendar on the period (see `mode`) around
   this date (the context key to use being `initial_date`)

Their root element is ``<calendar>``. Available attributes on the
calendar view are:

:string:
  string (default: ``''``)

  This view title is displayed only if you open an action that has no name and
  whose target is 'new' (opening a dialog)

:create:
  bool (default: ``True``)

  Disable/enable record creation on the view.

:edit:
  bool (default: ``True``)

  Disable/enable record edition on the view.

:delete:
  bool (default: ``True``)

  Disable/enable record deletion on the view through the **Action** dropdown.

.. rst-class:: o-definition-list

``date_start`` (required)
    name of the record's field holding the start date for the event
``date_stop``
    name of the record's field holding the end date for the event, if
    ``date_stop`` is provided records become movable (via drag and drop)
    directly in the calendar
``date_delay``
    alternative to ``date_stop``, provides the duration of the event instead of
    its end date (unit: day)
``color``
    name of a record field to use for *color segmentation*. Records in the
    same color segment are allocated the same highlight color in the calendar,
    colors are allocated semi-randomly.
    Displayed the display_name/avatar of the visible record in the sidebar
``form_view_id``
    view to open when the user create or edit an event. Note that if this attribute
    is not set, the calendar view will fall back to the id of the form view in the
    current action, if any.
``event_open_popup``
    If the option 'event_open_popup' is set to true, then the calendar view will
    open events (or records) in a FormViewDialog. Otherwise, it will open events
    in a new form view (with a do_action)
``quick_create``
    enables quick-event creation on click: only asks the user for a ``name``
    (the field to which this values is saved can be controlled through
    ``rec_name``) and tries to create a new event with just that and the clicked
    event time. Falls back to a full form dialog if the quick creation fails
``quick_create_view_id``
    View to open when the attribute ``quick_create`` is set and the user creates
    an event instead of the default dialog.
``create_name_field``
    name of the record's field holding the textual representation of the record,
    this is used when creating records through the 'quick create' mechanism
``all_day``
    name of a boolean field on the record indicating whether the corresponding
    event is flagged as day-long (and duration is irrelevant)
``mode``
    Default display mode when loading the calendar.
    Possible attributes are: ``day``, ``week``, ``month``, ``year``
``scales``
    Comma-separated list of scales to provide. By default, all scales are
    available. See mode for possible scale values.
``create``, ``delete``
    allows disabling the corresponding action in the view by setting the
    corresponding attribute to ``false``
``<field>``
  declares fields to aggregate or to use in kanban *logic*. If the field is
  simply displayed in the calendar cards.

  Fields can have additional attributes:

  .. rst-class:: o-definition-list

  ``invisible``
    use "True" to hide the value in the cards
  ``avatar_field``
    only for x2many field, to display the avatar instead of the display_name
    in the cards
  ``write_model`` and ``write_field`` and ``filter_field``
    you can add a filter and save the result in the defined model, the
    filter is added in the sidebar. The ``filter_field`` is optional and allows
    you to specify the field that will hold the status of the filter.
  ``filters`` and ``color``
    use "True" to add this field in filter in the sidebar. You can specify
    a ``color`` field used to colorize the checkbox.

.. _reference/view_architectures/activity:

Activity
========

The Activity view is used to display the activities linked to the records. The
data are displayed in a chart with the records forming the rows and the activity
types the columns. The first cell of each row displays a (customizable, see
``templates``, quite similarly to :ref:`reference/view_architectures/kanban`) card representing
the corresponding record. When clicking on others cells, a detailed description
of all activities of the same type for the record is displayed.

.. warning::

   The Activity view is only available when the ``mail`` module is installed,
   and for the models that inherit from the ``mail.activity.mixin``.

The root element of the Activity view is ``<activity>``, it accepts the following
attributes:

.. rst-class:: o-definition-list

``string`` (mandatory)
    A title, which should describe the view

Possible children of the view element are:

.. rst-class:: o-definition-list

``field``
  declares fields to use in activity *logic*. If the field is simply displayed
  in the activity view, it does not need to be pre-declared.

  Possible attributes are:

  .. rst-class:: o-definition-list

  ``name`` (required)
    the name of the field to fetch

``templates``
  defines the :ref:`reference/qweb` templates. Cards definition may be
  split into multiple templates for clarity, but activity views *must* define at
  least one root template ``activity-box``, which will be rendered once for each
  record.

  The activity view uses mostly-standard :ref:`javascript qweb
  <reference/qweb/javascript>` and provides the following context variables
  (see :ref:`reference/view_architectures/kanban` for more details):

  .. rst-class:: o-definition-list

  ``widget``
    the current :js:class:`ActivityRecord`, can be used to fetch some
    meta-information. These methods are also available directly in the
    template context and don't need to be accessed via ``widget``
  ``record``
    an object with all the requested fields as its attributes. Each field has
    two attributes ``value`` and ``raw_value``

.. _reference/view_architectures/cohort:

Cohort
======

.. raw:: html

   <span class="badge" style="background-color:#AD5E99">Enterprise feature</span>

The cohort view is used to display and understand the way some data changes over
a period of time.  For example, imagine that for a given business, clients can
subscribe to some service.  The cohort view can then display the total number
of subscriptions each month, and study the rate at which client leave the service
(churn). When clicking on a cell, the cohort view will redirect you to a new action
in which you will only see the records contained in the cell's time interval;
this action contains a list view and a form view.

.. note:: By default the cohort view will use the same list and form views as those
   defined on the action. You can pass a list view and a form view
   to the context of the action in order to set/override the views that will be
   used (the context keys to use being `form_view_id` and `list_view_id`)

For example, here is a very simple cohort view:

.. code-block:: xml

    <cohort string="Subscription" date_start="date_start" date_stop="date" interval="month"/>

The root element of the Cohort view is <cohort>, it accepts the following
attributes:

.. rst-class:: o-definition-list

``string`` (mandatory)
    A title, which should describe the view

``date_start`` (mandatory)
    A valid date or datetime field. This field is understood by the view as the
    beginning date of a record

``date_stop`` (mandatory)
    A valid date or datetime field. This field is understood by the view as the
    end date of a record.  This is the field that will determine the churn.

``disable_linking`` (optional)
  Set to ``1`` to prevent from redirecting clicks on cohort cells to list view.

``mode`` (optional)
    A string to describe the mode. It should be either 'churn' or
    'retention' (default). Churn mode will start at 0% and accumulate over time
    whereas retention will start at 100% and decrease over time.

``timeline`` (optional)
    A string to describe the timeline. It should be either 'backward' or 'forward' (default).
    Forward timeline will display data from date_start to date_stop, whereas backward timeline
    will display data from date_stop to date_start (when the date_start is in future / greater
    than date_stop).

``interval`` (optional)
    A string to describe a time interval. It should be 'day', 'week', 'month''
    (default) or 'year'.

``measure`` (optional)
    A field that can be aggregated.  This field will be used to compute the values
    for each cell.  If not set, the cohort view will count the number of occurrences.

``<field>`` (optional)
  allows to specify a particular field in order to manage it from the available measures, it's
  main use is for hiding a field from the selectable measures:

  .. rst-class:: o-definition-list

  ``name`` (mandatory)
    the name of the field to use in the view.
  ``string`` (optional)
    the name that would be used to display the field in the cohort view, overrides the
    default python String attribute of the field.
  ``invisible`` (optional)
    if true, the field will not appear either in the active measures nor in the selectable
    measures (useful for fields that do not make sense aggregated, such as fields in different
    units, e.g. € and $).
    If the value is a domain, the domain is evaluated in the context of the current row's
    record, if ``True`` the corresponding attribute is set on the cell.

Grid
====

.. raw:: html

   <span class="badge" style="background-color:#AD5E99">Enterprise feature</span>

Limitations
-----------

This view is a work in progress and may have to be expanded or altered.

* only ``date`` column fields have been tested, ``selection`` and ``many2one``
  are nominally implemented and supported but have not been tested,
  ``datetime`` is not implemented at all.
* column cells are hardly configurable and must be numerical
* cell adjustment is disabled by default and must be configured to be enabled
* ``create``, ``edit`` and ``delete`` ACL metadata doesn't get automatically
  set on the view root due to limitations in ``fields_view_get``
  post-processing (there's a fixed explicit list of the view types getting
  those attributes)

Schema
------

The grid view has its own schema and additional validation in this module. The
view architecture is:

``<grid>`` (1)
    architecture root element

    * mandatory ``string`` attribute
    * optional ``create``, ``edit`` and ``delete`` attributes
    * optional ``adjustment`` and ``adjust_name`` attributes

      ``adjustment`` can be either ``object`` or ``action`` to indicate
      whether a cell's adjustment should be performed through a method call
      or an action execution. ``adjust_name`` provides respectively the method
      name and the action id.

      In both cases, the adjustment parameters are provided as a
      ``grid_adjust`` context member, in the ``object`` case, the parameters
      are also provided as positional function parameters (next to an empty
      list of ids):

      ``row_domain``
        the domain matching the entire row of the adjusted cell
      ``column_field``
        the name of the column for the adjusted cell
      ``column_value``
        the value of the column for the adjusted cell
      ``cell_field``
        the measure field of the adjusted cell
      ``change``
        the difference between the old value of the cell and the adjusted one,
        may be positive or negative

    * optional ``hide_line_total`` and ``hide_column_total`` attributes

      ``hide_line_total``
        set to true to hide total line (default false)
      ``hide_column_total``
        set to true to hide total column (default false)

    * optional ``barchart_total`` attribute

      ``barchart_total``
        set to ``true`` in order to display a bar chart at the bottom of the grid, based on
        the totals of the columns (default false).

    * optional ``create_inline`` and ``display_empty`` attributes

      ``create_inline``
        set to ``true`` in order to display an additional row at bottom of the grid with an
        ``Add a line`` button (default false). When this option is set to ``true``, the ``Add a line`` button
        from the control panel is hidden. When no data is available and when ``display_empty`` is
        not set (so when the help content is displayed), the the ``Add a line`` button from the
        control panel is shown in order to let the user create a first record.
      ``display_empty``
        set to ``true`` in order to keep displaying the grid when there is no data (default false). This can
        be useful when you want the user to be able to keep track of the current period (as dates
        are displayed in the columns headers). As a reminder, when no data are present and when this
        attribute is no set, the help content is displayed instead of the grid.

``<button>`` (0+)
    Regular Odoo action buttons, displayed in the view header

    * mandatory ``string`` attribute (the button label)
    * mandatory ``type`` attribute, either ``object`` or ``action``

      .. note:: workflow buttons are not supported

    * mandatory ``name`` attribute, either the name of the method to call, or
      the ID of the action to execute
    * optional ``context``

    The server callback is provided with all the record ids displayed in the
    view, either as the ids passed to the method (``object`` button) or as
    the context's ``active_ids`` (``action`` buttons)

``<field type="row">`` (1+)
    Row grouping fields, will be replaced by the search view's groupby filter
    if any.

    The order of ``row`` fields in the view provides their grouping depth:
    if the first field is ``school`` and the second is ``age`` the records
    will be grouped by ``school`` first and by ``age`` within each school.

``<field type="col">`` (1)
    Column grouping field.

    The col field can contain 0+ ``<range>`` elements which specify
    customisable column ranges. ``range`` elements have the following
    mandatory attributes

    ``name``
        can be used to override the default range (the first one by default)
        through the ``grid_range`` context value
    ``string``
        the range button's label (user-visible)
    ``span``
        symbolic name of the span of all columns to display at once in the
        view, may trigger pagination.

        For ``date`` fields, valid spans are currently ``week`` and ``month``.
    ``step``
        symbolic name of the step between one column and the previous/next

        For ``date`` fields, the only valid span is currently ``day``.
``<field type="measure">`` (1)
    Cell field, automatically accumulated (by ``read_group``).

    The measure field can take a ``widget`` attribute to customise its
    display.

Server interactions
-------------------

Aside from optional buttons, the grid view currently calls two methods:

* ``read_grid`` (provided on all models by the module) returns almost the
  entirety of the grid's content as a dict:

  * the row titles is a list of dictionaries with the following keys:

    ``values`` (required)
        this maps to a dictionary with a key per ``row`` field, the values are
        *always* of the form ``[value, label]``.
    ``domain`` (required)
        the domain of any record at the source of this row, in case it's
        necessary to copy a record during cell adjustment

  * the column titles is a list of dictionaries with at least one key:

    ``values`` (required)
        see row title values
    ``domain`` (required)
        see column domain value
    ``current`` (optional)
        boolean, marks/highlights a column

  * the grid data as a list (of rows) of list (of cells) of cell dicts each
    with the following keys:

    ``value``
        the numeric value associated with the cell
    ``domain``
        the domain matching the cell's records (should be assumed opaque)
    ``size``
        the number of records grouped in the cell
    ``readonly`` (optional)
        a boolean indicating that this specific cell should not be
        client-editable
    ``classes`` (optional)
        a list of classes (as strings) to add on the cell's container (between
        the cell's TD and the cell's potentially-editable element).

        In case of conflicts between this list and the base classes (prefixed
        with ``o_grid_cell_``), the classes in this list are ignored.

    Note that the grid data is *dense*, if querying the database yields no
    group matching a cell a cell will generate an "empty" cell with default
    values for required keys.
  * ``prev`` and ``next`` which can be either falsy (no pagination) or a
    context item to merge into the view's own context to ``read_grid`` the
    previous or next page, it should be assumed to be opaque

* ``read_grid_domain(field, range)`` (provided on al models by the module)
  returns the domain matching the current configured "span" of the grid. This
  is also done internally by ``read_grid``, but can be useful or necessary to
  call independently to use with separate e.g. ``search_count`` or
  ``read_group``.

* ``adjust_grid``, for which there currently isn't a blanket implementation
  and whose semantics are likely to evolve with time and use cases

Server Hooks
------------

``read_grid`` calls a number of hooks allowing the customisation of its
operations from within without having to override the entire method:

``_grid_format_cell(group, cell_field)``
    converts the output of a read_group (group-by-group) into cells in the
    format described above (as part of "the grid data")
``_grid_make_empty_cell(row_domain, column_domain, view_domain)``
    generates an empty version of a cell (if there is no corresponding group)
``_grid_column_info(name, range)``
    generates a ColumnMetadata object based on the column type, storing values
    either returned directly (as part of ``read_grid``) or used query and
    reformat ``read_group`` into ``read_grid``:

    ``grouping``
        the actual grouping field/query for the columns
    ``domain``
        domain to apply to ``read_group`` in case the column field is
        paginated, can be an empty list
    ``prev`` and ``next``
        context segments which will be sent to ``read_grid`` for pages before
        and after the current one. If ``False``, disables pagination in that
        direction
    ``values``
        column values to display on the "current page", each value is a
        dictionary with the following keys:

        ``values``
            dictionary mapping field names to values for the entire column,
            usually just ``name`` -> a value
        ``domain``
            domain matching this specific column
        ``is_current``
            ``True`` if the current column should be specifically outlined in
            the grid, ``False`` otherwise
        ``format``
            how to format the values of that column/type from ``read_group``
            formatting to ``read_grid`` formatting (matching ``values`` in
            ColumnInfo)

ACL
---

* if the view is not editable, individual cells won't be editable
* if the view is not creatable, the ``Add a Line`` button will not be
  displayed (it currently creates a new empty record)

Context Keys
------------

``grid_range``
    selects which range should be used by default if the view has multiple
    ranges
``grid_anchor``
    if applicable, used as the default anchor of column ranges instead of
    whatever ``read_grid`` defines as its default.

    For date fields, the reference date around which the initial span will be
    computed. The default date anchor is "today" (in the user's timezone)

.. _reference/view_architectures/gantt:

Gantt
=====

.. raw:: html

   <span class="badge" style="background-color:#AD5E99">Enterprise feature</span>

Gantt views appropriately display Gantt charts (for scheduling).

The root element of gantt views is ``<gantt/>``, it has no children but can
take the following attributes:

:string:
  string (default: ``''``)

  This view title is displayed only if you open an action that has no name and
  whose target is 'new' (opening a dialog)

:create:
  bool (default: ``True``)

  Disable/enable record creation on the view.

:edit:
  bool (default: ``True``)

  Disable/enable record edition on the view.

:delete:
  bool (default: ``True``)

  Disable/enable record deletion on the view through the **Action** dropdown.

.. rst-class:: o-definition-list

``date_start`` (required)
  name of the field providing the start datetime of the event for each
  record.
``date_stop`` (required)
  name of the field providing the end duration of the event for each
  record.
``dependency_field``
  name of the ``many2many`` field that provides the dependency relation between two records.
  If B depends on A, ``dependency_field`` is the field that allows getting A
  from B. Both this field and ``dependency_inverted_field`` field are used to
  draw dependency arrows between pills and reschedule them.
``dependency_inverted_field`` (required if ``dependency_field`` is provided)
  name of the ``many2many`` field that provides the invert dependency relation than
  ``dependency_field``. If B depends on A, ``dependency_inverted_field`` is
  the field that allows getting B from A.
``color``
  name of the field used to color the pills according to its value
``decoration-{$name}``
  `python expression`_ that evaluates to a bool

  allow changing the style of a cell's text based on the corresponding
  record's attributes.

  ``{$name}`` can be one of the following `bootstrap contextual color`_ (``danger``,
  ``info``, ``secondary``, ``success`` or ``warning``).

  Define a conditional display of a record in the style of a row's text based on the corresponding
  record's attributes.

  Values are Python expressions. For each record, the expression is evaluated
  with the record's attributes as context values and if ``true``, the
  corresponding style is applied to the row. Here are some of the other values
  available in the context:

  * ``uid``: the id of the current user,
  * ``today``: the current local date as a string of the form ``YYYY-MM-DD``,
  * ``now``: same as ``today`` with the addition of the current time.
    This value is formatted as ``YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss``.

  .. code-block:: xml

    <gantt decoration-info="state == 'draft'"
          decoration-danger="state == 'help_needed'"
          decoration-bf="state == 'busy'">
      ...
    </gantt>
``default_group_by``
  name of a field to group tasks by
``disable_drag_drop``
  if set to true, the gantt view will not have any drag&drop support
``consolidation``
  field name to display consolidation value in record cell
``consolidation_max``
  dictionary with the "group by" field as key and the maximum consolidation
  value that can be reached before displaying the cell in red
  (e.g. ``{"user_id": 100}``)
``consolidation_exclude``
  name of the field that describes if the task has to be excluded
  from the consolidation
  if set to true it displays a striped zone in the consolidation line
``create``, ``cell_create``, ``edit``, ``delete``, ``plan``
    allows *dis*\ abling the corresponding action in the view by setting the
    corresponding attribute to ``false`` (default: ``true``).

    * ``create``: If enabled, an ``Add`` button will be available in the control
      panel to create records.
    * ``cell_create``: If enabled and ``create`` enabled, a "**+**" button will be
      displayed while hovering on a time slot cell to create a new record on that slot.
    * ``edit``: If enabled, the opened records will be in edit mode (thus editable).
    * ``plan``: If enabled and ``edit`` enabled, a "magnifying glass" button will be displayed
      on time slots to plan unassigned records into that time slot.

    .. example::

        When you do not want to create records on the gantt view and the beginning and end
        dates are required on the model, the planning feature should be disabled
        because no record will ever be found.
``offset``
  Depending on the scale, the number of units to add to today to compute the
  default period. Examples: An offset of +1 in default_scale week will open the
  gantt view for next week, and an offset of -2 in default_scale month will open
  the gantt view of 2 months ago.
``progress``
  name of a field providing the completion percentage for the record's event,
  between 0 and 100
``string``
  title of the gantt view
``precision``
  JSON object specifying snapping precisions for the pills in each scale.

  Possible values for scale ``day`` are (default: ``hour``):

  - ``hour``: records times snap to full hours (ex: 7:12 becomes 8:00)

  - ``hour:half``: records times snap to half hours (ex: 7:12 becomes 7:30)

  - ``hour:quarter``: records times snap to half hours (ex: 7:12 becomes 7:15)

  Possible values for scale ``week`` are (default: ``day:half``):

  - ``day``: records times snap to full days (ex: 7:28 AM becomes 11:59:59 PM of the previous day, 10:32 PM becomes 12:00 PM of the current day)

  - ``day:half``: records times snap to half hours (ex: 7:28 AM becomes 12:00 PM)

  Possible values for scale ``month`` are (default: ``day:half``):

  - ``day``: records times snap to full days (ex: 7:28 AM becomes 11:59:59 PM of the previous day, 10:32 PM becomes 12:00 PM of the current day)

  - ``day:half``: records times snap to half hours (ex: 7:28 AM becomes 12:00 PM)

  Scale ``year`` always snap to full day.

  Example of precision attribute: ``{"day": "hour:quarter", "week": "day:half", "month": "day"}``
``total_row``
  boolean to control whether the row containing the total count of records should
  be displayed. (default: ``false``)
``collapse_first_level``
  boolean to control whether it is possible to collapse each row if grouped by
  one field. (default: ``false``, the collapse starts when grouping by two fields)
``display_unavailability``
  boolean to mark the dates returned by the ``gantt_unavailability`` function of
  the model as available inside the gantt view. Records can still be scheduled
  in them, but their unavailability is visually displayed. (default: ``false``)
``default_scale``
  default scale when rendering the view. Possible values are (default: ``month``):

  * ``day``
  * ``week``
  * ``month``
  * ``year``

``scales``
  comma-separated list of allowed scales for this view. By default, all scales
  are allowed. For possible scale values to use in this list, see ``default_scale``.

``templates``
  defines the :ref:`reference/qweb` template ``gantt-popover`` which is used
  when the user hovers over one of the records in the gantt view.

  The gantt view uses mostly-standard :ref:`javascript qweb
  <reference/qweb/javascript>` and provides the following context variables:

  .. rst-class:: o-definition-list

  ``widget``
    the current :js:class:`GanttRow`, can be used to fetch some
    meta-information. The ``getColor`` method to convert in a color integer is
    also available directly in the template context without using ``widget``.

  ``on_create``
    If specified when clicking the add button on the view, instead of opening a generic dialog, launch a client action.
    this should hold the xmlid of the action (eg: ``on_create="%(my_module.my_wizard)d"``

``form_view_id``
  view to open when the user create or edit a record. Note that if this attribute
  is not set, the gantt view will fall back to the id of the form view in the
  current action, if any.

``dynamic_range``
  if set to true, the gantt view will start at the first record,
  instead of starting at the beginning of the year/month/day.

``pill_label``
  If set to true, the time appears in the pill label when the scale is set on week or month. (e.g.
  `7:00 AM - 11:00 AM (4h) - DST Task 1`)

``thumbnails``
  This allows to display a thumbnail next to groups name if the group is a relationnal field.
  This expects a python dict which keys are the name of the field on the active model.
  Values are the names of the field holding the thumbnail on the related model.

  Example: tasks have a field user_id that reference res.users. The res.users model has a field image that holds the avatar,
  then:

  .. code-block:: xml

     <gantt
        date_start="date_start"
        date_stop="date_stop"
        thumbnails="{'user_id': 'image_128'}"
      >
      </gantt>

  will display the users avatars next to their names when grouped by user_id.

.. include:: view_architectures/root_attribute_sample.rst

.. _reference/view_architectures/map:

Map
===

.. raw:: html

   <span class="badge" style="background-color:#AD5E99">Enterprise feature</span>

This view is able to display records on a map and the routes between them. The records are represented by pins. It also allows the visualization of fields from the model in a popup tied to the record's pin.

.. note::

    The model on which the view is applied should contain a `res.partner` many2one since the view relies on the `res.partner`'s address and coordinates fields to localize the records.

API
---

The view uses location data platforms' API to fetch the tiles (the map's background), do the geoforwarding (converting addresses to a set of coordinates) and fetch the routes.
The view implements two API, OpenStreetMap and MapBox. OpenStreetMap is used by default and is able to fetch `tiles`_ and do `geoforwarding`_. This API does not require a token.
As soon as a valid `MapBox`_ token is provided in the general settings the view switches to the MapBox API. This API is faster and allows the computation of routes. A token can be obtained by `signing up`_ to MapBox.

Structural components
---------------------

The view's root element is ``<map>``. It can have the following attributes:


.. rst-class:: o-definition-list

``res_partner``
    Contains the `res.partner` many2one. If not provided the view resorts to create an empty map.
``default_order``
    If a field is provided the view overrides the model's default order. The field must be part of the model on which the view is applied, not from `res.partner`.
``routing``
    if ``1`` display the routes between the records. The view needs a valid MapBox token and at least two located records (i.e the records have a `res.partner` many2one and the partner has an address or valid coordinates).
``hide_name``
    if ``1`` hide the name from the pin's popup (default: ``0``).
``hide_address``
    if ``1`` hide the address from the pin's popup (default: ``0``).
``hide_title``
    if ``1`` hide the title from the pin list (default: ``0``).
``panel_title``
    String to display as title of the pin list. If not provided, the title is the action's name or "Items" if the view is not in an action.
``limit``
    Maximum number of records to fetch (default: ``80``). It must be a positive integer.

The ``<map>`` element can contain multiple ``<field>`` elements. Each ``<field>`` element is interpreted as a line in the pin's popup. The field's attributes are the following:

.. rst-class:: o-definition-list

``name``
    The field to display.
``string``
    String to display before the field's content. It can be used as a description.

For example here is a map:
    .. code-block:: xml

        <map res_partner="partner_id" default_order="date_begin" routing="1" hide_name="1">
            <field name="partner_id" string="Customer Name"/>
        </map>
