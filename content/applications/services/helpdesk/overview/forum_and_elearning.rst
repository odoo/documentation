Forum
=====

To go above and beyond email, live chat, web forms, and phone lines, offer your customers a
support forum. This way, customers might become more attached to your company as they would be
investing time to get into details of your business. You also encourage the exchange of experiences
and knowledge, supporting the feeling of belonging to a community (your community!).

Set up
------

Go to :menuselection:`Helpdesk --> Configuration --> Helpdesk Team` and enable *Help Center*.

In addition to a forum, offer online courses. When doing so, you link your customers and users’
needs and questions to useful content, helping to boost efficiency as they can also find their
answers there.
