Available reports
=================

Details about the reports available in Odoo **Helpdesk** can be found below. To view the different
reports, go to :menuselection:`Helpdesk app --> Reporting`, and select one of the following:
:guilabel:`Tickets Analysis`, :guilabel:`SLA Status Analysis`, or :guilabel:`Customer Ratings`.

Tickets Analysis
----------------

The *Tickets Analysis* report (:menuselection:`Helpdesk app --> Reporting --> Tickets Analysis`)
provides an overview of every customer support ticket in the database.

This report is useful for identifying where teams are spending the most time, and helps determine if
there is an uneven workload distribution among the support staff. The default report counts the
number of tickets per team and groups them by stage.

Alternative measures can be selected to track where the most time is spent at different points in
the workflow. To change the measures used for the report that is currently displayed, or to add
more, click the :guilabel:`Measures` button, and select one or more options from the drop-down menu:

- :guilabel:`Average Hours to Respond`: average number of working hours between a message sent from
  the customer and the response from the support team. *This does not include messages sent when the
  ticket was in a folded stage.*
- :guilabel:`Hours Open`: number of hours between the date the ticket was created and the closed
  date. If there is no closed date on the ticket, the current date is used. **This measure is not
  specific to working hours.**
- :guilabel:`Hours Spent (Timesheets)`: number of *Timesheet* hours logged on a ticket. *This
  measure is only available if Timesheets are enabled on a team, and the current user has the access
  rights to view them.*
- :guilabel:`Hours to First Response`: number of working hours between the date the ticket was
  received and the date on which the first message was sent. *This does not include email sent
  automatically when a ticket reaches a stage.*

  Okay/Neutral = 3, Satisfied = 5).

SLA Status Analysis
-------------------

The *SLA Status Analysis* report (:menuselection:`Helpdesk app --> Reporting --> SLA Status
Analysis`) :ref:`analyzes the performance <helpdesk/analyze-sla-performance>` of individual SLA
(Service Level Agreement) policies.

By default, this report is filtered to show the number of |SLAs| failed, in progress, and the number
that have been successful. The results are grouped by teams.

Use cases
=========

Assessing performance based on customer priority
------------------------------------------------

The :guilabel:`Tickets Analysis` report can be used to evaluate the time it takes to address
high-priority tickets compared to standard ones. This helps ensure that high-priority tickets are
resolved promptly, and identifies any discrepancies in response times based on priority.

First, navigate to :menuselection:`Helpdesk app --> Reporting --> Tickets Analysis`. Click
:guilabel:`Measures`, then select :guilabel:`Working Hours to Close`. Click into the search bar,
then under :guilabel:`Group By`, select :guilabel:`Priority`. Finally, under :guilabel:`Filters`,
select :guilabel:`Closed`.

.. tip::
   The pivot view is also useful for this version of the report.

Monitoring SLA compliance over time
-----------------------------------

The :guilabel:`SLA Status Analysis` report can be used to track |SLA| compliance trends to identify
periods with higher |SLA| breaches. |SLA| breaches happen when support teams fail to meet the
response or resolution times promised in |SLAs|, leading to dissatisfied customers, potential
financial penalties, and decreased team morale. Identifying these breaches is crucial for tracking
real-time performance, uncovering patterns, and addressing root causesâ€”like staffing issues or
process inefficiencies.

First, navigate to :menuselection:`Helpdesk app --> Reporting --> SLA Status Analysis`. Click the
:icon:`fa-area-chart` :guilabel:`(Graph)` icon, then the :icon:`fa-line-chart` :guilabel:`(Line
Chart)` icon.

.. note::
   While the :guilabel:`SLA Status Analysis` report defaults to the pivot view, the line chart view
   provides a better visual representation for this specific use case.

Click :guilabel:`Measures`, then select :guilabel:`Number of SLAs Failed`. Doing so ensures the data
on the report shows **only** information for tickets that failed at least one |SLA|. Click into the
search bar, then under :guilabel:`Group By`, select :guilabel:`SLA Deadline`, and select a time
frame, either :guilabel:`Month`, :guilabel:`Week`, or :guilabel:`Day`. This option shows when the
highest number of tickets with |SLAs| are failing, allowing the team to identify patterns, and
prepare for potential issues.

.. tip::
   The time frame selected for this report may vary depending on a few factors, including the amount
   of tickets received on a regular basis, the number of |SLAs| enabled in the database, and the
   workload of the team. It is worth experimenting to see what option delivers the most insights.
