Advanced Project Settings
=========================

Projects can be created for a specific customer or team, and can be coordinated among your
employees through visibility options. Stages can be shared among tasks, and the exact time spent on
each project can be tracked. All of it in favor of a more integrated and dynamic organization.

Create advanced projects
========================
| Go to :menuselection:`Project --> Configuration --> Projects --> Create`.
| Choose a *Customer* in order to create a project specifically for him. If not, simply leave the

Share stages across projects
============================

  delineate specific stages for different projects.
| :doc:`Activate the Developer mode <../../general/developer_mode/activate>` then go to
  :menuselection:`Project --> Configuration --> Stages`. Choose the respective one and add
  the projects among which you would like to share stages.
