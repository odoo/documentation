Odoo Online
===========

`Odoo Online <https://www.odoo.com/trial>`_ provides private databases which are fully managed and
hosted by Odoo. It can be used for long-term production or to test Odoo thoroughly, including
customizations that don't require code.

.. note::
   Odoo Online is incompatible with custom modules or the Odoo App Store.

Odoo Online databases are accessed using any web browser and do not require a local installation.

To quickly try out Odoo, shared `demo <https://demo.odoo.com>`_ instances are available. No
registration is required, but each instance only lives for a few hours.

Database management
===================

To manage a database, go to the `database manager <https://www.odoo.com/my/databases>`_ and sign in
as the database administrator.

All the main database management options are available by clicking the database name, except the
upgrade option, which can be accessed by clicking the **arrow in a circle** icon next to the
database name. It is only displayed if an upgrade is available.
