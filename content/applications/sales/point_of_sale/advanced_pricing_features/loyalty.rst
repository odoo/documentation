You can decide what type of program you wish to use, if the reward is a
discount or a gift, make it specific to some products or cover your
whole range. Apply rules so that it is only valid in specific situation
and everything in between.

Use the loyalty program in your PoS interface

When a customer is set, you will now see the points they will get for
the transaction and they will accumulate until they are spent. They are
spent using the button *Rewards* when they have enough points
according to the rules defined in the loyalty program.
