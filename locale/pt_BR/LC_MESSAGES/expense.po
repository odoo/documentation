msgid "How to set expense types"
msgstr "Como definir os tipos de despesas"

msgid "The first step to track expenses is to configure the expense types (managed as products in Odoo) that your company allows, from the *Configuration* menu. When a specific expense is reimbursed at a fixed price, set a cost on the product. Otherwise keep the cost at 0.0 and employees will report the real cost per expense."

It's usually a good practice to use a tax that is configured with *Tax Included in Price* (see: :doc:`../accounting/others/taxes/tax_included`). That way, employees report expenses with prices including taxes, which is usually the expected behaviour."
