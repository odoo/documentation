You can set several criterias to use a specific price: periods, min.
quantity (meet a minimum ordered quantity and get a price break), etc.
You can also chose to only apply that pricelist on specific products or
on the whole range.

======================================

You now have a new button above the *Customer* one, use it to
instantly select the right pricelist.

can finalize the order in your usual way.

    applied. You can of course change it.
