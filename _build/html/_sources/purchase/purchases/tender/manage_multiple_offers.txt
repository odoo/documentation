How to manage multiple offers from suppliers with purchase tenders?
===================================================================

A **Purchase Tender** (PT), also known as Call for Bids, is used to
drive competition between several suppliers in order to get the best
offer for a list of products. In comparison to the RfQ, a Purchase
Tender is sent to multiple suppliers, stating each are competing with
one another, and that the best offer will win. The main interest is that
it usually leads to better offers.

For more information on best uses, please read the chapter :doc:`../../overview/difference`

Configuration
=============

Activating the Purchase Tender function
---------------------------------------

you must first activate the option.

In the Purchases module, open the Configuration menu and click on
Settings. In the Purchase Order section, locate the **Calls for
Tenders** and tick the box Allow using call for tendersâ€¦ (advanced),
then click on **Apply**.

suppliers to send in more than one Request for Quotation.
