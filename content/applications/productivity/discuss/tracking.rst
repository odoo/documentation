How to follow a discussion thread
=================================
You can keep track of virtually any business object in Odoo
(an opportunity, a quotation, a task, etc.), by **following** it.

How to add other followers
==========================
You can invite other users and add channels as followers. Adding a
channel as a follower will send messages posted in the chatter to the
channel with a link back to the original document.

How to be a default follower
============================
You are automatically set as a default follower of any item
you create. In some applications like CRM and Project, you can 
be a default follower of any new record created to get notified
of specific events (e.g. a new task created, an opportunity won). 

To do so, start following the parent business object
(e.g. the sales channel in CRM, the project in Project). 
Then, choose the events you want to hear about.
