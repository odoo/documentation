4. Input the Pairing Code and click on the Pair button.

.. note::
   Recent changes in modern web browsers forced us to modify the connection wizard.
   If your screen is different from the screenshots, make sure that the
   ``iot_pairing`` module is installed.

4. You will be redirected to the IoT Box Homepage (if it doesn't work,
   connect to the IP address of the box). Give a name to your IoT Box (not
   required) and paste the token, then click on next.

   .. tip::
      If you are on Runbot, do not forget to add the -all or -base in the
      token (e.g. this token
      **http://375228-saas-11-5-iot-f3f920.runbot16.odoo.com\|4957098401**
      should become
      **http://375228-saas-11-5-iot-f3f920-all.runbot16.odoo.com\|4957098401**).

5. Choose the WiFi network you want to connect with (enter the password
   if there is one) and click on Submit. Wait a few seconds before being
   redirected to your database.
