You need the following credentials to set up the payment method in Odoo:

#. :doc:`Activate the POS Razorpay module <../../../../general/apps_modules>` to enable the
   payment terminal.
#. :doc:`Create the related payment method <../../payment_methods>` by going to
   :menuselection:`Point of Sale --> Configuration --> Payment Methods`.

   .. note::
      You can enable the :guilabel:`Razorpay Test Mode` field while testing or keep it unchecked for
      production.

Once the payment method is created, you can enable it for your POS. To do so, go to the :ref:`POS'
settings <configuration/settings>` and add the payment method under the :guilabel:`Payment` section.

Pay with a payment terminal
===========================

When processing a payment, select the Razorpay payment method. Check the amount and click
:guilabel:`Send`. Once the payment is successful, the status changes to :guilabel:`Payment
Successful`. To cancel the payment request, click :guilabel:`Cancel`.

.. note::
   - | In case of connection issues between Odoo and the payment terminal, force the payment by
       clicking on :guilabel:`Force Done`, which allows you to validate the order.
     | This option is only available after receiving an error message informing you that the
       connection failed.
   - The terminal must have at least a 10% battery level to use it.
