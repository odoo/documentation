Flashing your SD Card
=====================

In some case, you may need to reflash your IoT Box’s SD Card to benefit
from our latest updates.

Upgrade from the IoT Box homepage
=================================

Go to the IoT Box homepage, click on *Update*, next to the version number.
If a new version of the IoT Box image is available, you will see a
*Upgrade to ___* button a the bottom of the page, the IoT Box will then
flash itself to the new version of the IoT Box. All of your configurations
will be saved.

.. note::
   This process can take more than 30 minutes. Do not turn off or unplug
   the IoT Box as it would leave it in an inconsistent state.
