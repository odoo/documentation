How to use Google Spreadsheet in Addition to my Data?
=====================================================

Create custom dashboards in Google Spreadsheet that retrieves data directly from Odoo using
spreadsheet formula. You can use it to create sales commission plans, budgets, project forecasts,
etc. Formulas are written in Python but programming skills are not required.

Configuration
=============

From the *General Settings*, active *Google Drive* and *Google Spreadsheet*. The options
*Authorization Code* and *Get Authorization Code* are now available.

Applications
============

You have 2 different formulas of using Google Spreadsheet in Odoo: retrieve data and retrieve
grouped sums.

.. warning::
   Google Drive limits the execution time of scripts; if the data you requested takes
   too long to be delivered, you might get an error. There is no specific size limit, since the
   time for Odoo to respond depends on several factors - although reading data regarding several
   thousand records is usually fine.


Retrieve Data
-------------

| The theoretical formula is :command:`= oe_browse (table;columns;filters;orderby:limit)`.
  Used it if you want to display the information without grouping it (e.g.: each sales
  order in the database).
| Find some the arguments in the table below.

Retrieve Grouped Sums
---------------------

| The theoretical formula is :command:`= oe_read_group (table;columns;group_by;filters;orderby:limit)`.
  Use it when you want to display a sum of data (e.g.: total invoiced).
| Find some arguments in the table below.
