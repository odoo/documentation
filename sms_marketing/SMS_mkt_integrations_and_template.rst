Integrations and Templates
==================================
Using SMS to reach people can be a strategy not just used for advertisement purposes but also as a reminder of events or issued invoices to your costumers, for example.
As you know, one of the biggest benefits of using Odoo is the capability of the apps to be integrated. 
With the SMS Marketing app isn’t different!

Organize Email Marketing and SMS campaigns
===========================================
First, make sure to have the necessary feature activated. Go to the :menuselection:`Email Marketing
app --> Configuration --> Settings --> activate the option Mailing Campaigns`.

Now, I’ll also have the menu *Campaigns* included in my *SMS Marketing* page, allowing me to have an overview of my SMS mailings and my email marketing ones.

This feature is especially useful if I have aggregated campaigns, as I have a global reporting view. In addition to that, I can create stages in my kanban view to better organize the work being done.

Sending SMSs through the Contacts app
======================================
Sending SMSs through the contact’s form is available by default in Odoo. It makes my work easier if I need to send an SMS to a specific contact, for example.
For that, I’ll go to the *Contacts* app, select the contact and click on the *SMS* icon next to the phone number.

If I’d like to send a message in a batch here, I could go to :menuselection:`List View --> select
all the contacts --> Action --> Send SMS`.

Set up SMS Templates
==================================
To set up *SMS Templates*, I’ll go to the *Settings* app and activate the *developer mode*. Now,
back to *Settings* app, I’ll go to :menuselection:`Technical --> Phone/SMS section -->
SMS Templates` and create the content I need.
