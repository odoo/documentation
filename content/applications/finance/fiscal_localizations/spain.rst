Spanish chart of accounts
=========================

Several Spanish charts of accounts are available by default in Odoo:

- PGCE PYMEs 2008
- PGCE Completo 2008
- PGCE Entitades

To choose the one you want, go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`,
then select a package in the :guilabel:`Fiscal localization` section.

.. tip::
    When you create a new Odoo Online database, the PGCE PYMEs 2008 is installed by default.

.. warning::
   You can only change the accounting package as long as you have not created any accounting entry.

- Tax Report (Modelo 115)
- Tax Report (Modelo 303)
