Create a quotation using subscription products
==============================================

Selling a digital product or service gives instant gratification. However, you have to work hard for
a new customer to make a purchase. It costs time and money. By convincing customers to sign up for a
subscription, you maximize your income and streamline your cash flow. You can sell any type of
product or service through a subscription business model.

   <div align="center" style="color:#AD5E99; font-size: 2rem ;margin: 20px 0"> <b>The only limit is
   your imagination.</b> </div>

Here is a scenario using **Odoo Subscriptions** to create a quotation including subscription
products.

Create your first quotation
===========================

Before creating your first quotation, be sure to check out our documentation on how to create and
manage your own
:doc:`Subscription templates <../../subscriptions/configuration/subscription_templates>`
and on how to add
:doc:`Subscription products <../../subscriptions/configuration/subscription_products>`
to your templates.

.. important::

   These steps are **mandatory** to make a basic sales flow using **Odoo Subscriptions**.

Go to **Odoo Sales** and create a new quotation. Then, choose a customer and add a product.
Be careful to select a product that you previously configured as a *Subscription product*.

When your quotation is ready, you have the possibility to send it to your customers or to confirm
it. It is better to first *Send by email* the quotation to your customers to have their confirmation
and, then, *Confirm* it in **Odoo Sales**. By clicking on *Customer preview*, you have an idea of
what your customers will see when receiving your quotation.

From there, your customers have three choices: *Sign & Pay* the quotation, give you a *Feedback* or
*Reject* the quotation. It appears that they are very happy and accept the option *Sign & Pay*.
Then, they have to validate the order with a signature and by choosing a payment method. When it is
done, you can check out the quotation in **Odoo Sales** and *Confirm* it.

Manage your subscriptions from your SO
======================================

Once confirmed, the quotation becomes a sales order and a new button appears, *Subscriptions*.
Indeed, a subscription is automatically created.

By clicking on the *Subscriptions* button, you can see that the status of the subscription is
*In progress*. From there, you will have three options:
:doc:`Renew <../../subscriptions/sales_flow/renewals>`,
:doc:`Close <../../subscriptions/sales_flow/closing>` or
:doc:`Upsell <../../subscriptions/sales_flow/upselling>` your subscription.

In the top-right corner, you can see the status of the subscription. When a subscription is new and
created from **Odoo Subscriptions**, the status is *Draft*. When a sales order has been validated,
the status is *In progress*. Finally, when a customer decides to close his subscription, the status
becomes *Closed*.
