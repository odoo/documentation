Introduction
============

With the Brazilian localization, sales taxes can be automatically computed and electronic invoices
for goods (NF-e) and services (NFS-e) can be sent using AvaTax (Avalara) through |API| calls.
Moreover, taxes for services can be configured.

For the goods and services tax computation and electronic invoicing process, you need to configure
the :ref:`contacts <brazil/contacts>`, :ref:`company <brazil/company>`, :ref:`products
<brazil/products>`, and :ref:`create an account in AvaTax <brazil/avatax-account>` which needs to be
configured in the general settings.

For the services taxes, you can create and configure them from Odoo directly without computing them
with AvaTax.

The localization also includes taxes and a chart of accounts template that can be modified if
needed.

.. _brazil/avatax-account:

Configure AvaTax integration
----------------------------

Avalara AvaTax is a tax calculation and electronic invoicing provider that can be integrated in Odoo
to automatically compute taxes by taking into account the company, contact (customer), product, and
transaction information to retrieve the correct tax to be used and process the e-invoice afterward
with the government.

Using this integration requires :doc:`In-App-Purchases (IAPs) <../../essentials/in_app_purchase>` to
compute the taxes and to send the electronic invoices. Whenever you compute taxes, send an
electronic document (NF-e, NFS-e, etc), or perform any electronic flow (NF-e Cancellation,
Correction letter, Invalidate invoice number range), an API call is made using credits from your
`IAP credits balance <https://iap.odoo.com/iap/in-app-services/819>`_.

.. note::
   - Odoo is a certified partner of Avalara Brazil.
   - You can `buy IAP credit on odoo.com <https://iap.odoo.com/iap/in-app-services/819>`_.
   - On creation, new databases receive 500 free credits.

Credential configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To activate AvaTax in Odoo, you need to create an account. To do so, go to
:menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Taxes`, and in the :guilabel:`AvaTax
Brazil` section, add the administration email address to be used for the AvaTax portal in the
:guilabel:`AvaTax Portal Email`, and then click on :guilabel:`Create account`.

.. warning::
   When **testing** or **creating a production** :guilabel:`AvaTax Portal Email` integration in a
   sandbox or production database, use a real email address, as it is needed to log in to the
   Avalara Portal and set up the certificates, whether you want to test or use it on production.

   There are two different Avalara Portals, one for testing and one for production:

   - Sandbox: https://portal.sandbox.avalarabrasil.com.br/
   - Production: https://portal.avalarabrasil.com.br/

   When you create the account from Odoo, be sure to select the right environment. Moreover, the
   email used to open the account cannot be used to open another account. Save your :guilabel:`API
   ID` and :guilabel:`API Key` when you create the account from Odoo.

   .. image:: brazil/transfer-api-credentials.png
      :alt: Transfer API Credentials.

After you create the account from Odoo, you need to go to the Avalara Portal to set up your
password:

#. Access the `Avalara portal <https://portal.avalarabrasil.com.br/Login>`_.
#. Click on :guilabel:`Meu primeiro acesso`.
#. Add the email address you used in Odoo to create the Avalara/AvaTax account, and then click
   :guilabel:`Solicitar Senha`.
#. You will receive an email with a token and a link to create your password. Click on this link and
   copy-paste the token to allocate your desired password.

.. tip::
   You can start using AvaTax in Odoo for tax computation **only** without creating a password and
   accessing the Avalara portal in the Odoo database. However, in order to use the electronic
   invoice service, you **must** access the AvaTax portal and upload your certificate there.

.. image:: brazil/avatax-account-configuration.png
   :alt: AvaTax account configuration.

.. note::
   You can transfer |API| credentials. Use this only when you have already created an account in
   another Odoo instance and wish to reuse it.

A1 certificate upload
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to issue electronic invoices, a certificate needs to be uploaded to the `AvaTax portal
<https://portal.avalarabrasil.com.br/Login>`_.

The certificate will be synchronized with Odoo, as long as the external identifier number in the
AvaTax portal matches - without special characters - with the CNPJ number, and the identification
number (CNPJ) in Odoo matches with the CNPJ in AvaTax.

.. important::
   To issue NFS-e, some cities require that you link the certificate within the City Portal system
   before issuing NFS-e from Odoo.

   If you receive an error message from the city that says :guilabel:`Your certificate is not linked
   to the user`, that means this process needs to be done in the city portal.

Configure master data
---------------------

Chart of accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :doc:`chart of accounts <../accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts>` is installed by default
as part of the data set included in the localization module. The accounts are mapped automatically
in their corresponding taxes, and the default account payable and account receivable fields.

.. note::
   The chart of accounts for Brazil is based on the SPED CoA, which gives a baseline of the accounts
   needed in Brazil.

   You can add or delete accounts according to the company's needs.

Journals
~~~~~~~~

In Brazil, a *series* number is linked to a sequence number range for electronic invoices. The
series number can be configured in Odoo on a sales journal from the :guilabel:`Series` field. If
more than one series is needed, then a new sales journal will need to be created and a new series
number assigned to it for each series needed.

The :guilabel:`Use Documents` field needs to be selected. When issuing electronic and non-electronic
invoices, the :guilabel:`Type` field selects the document type used when creating the invoice. The
:guilabel:`Type` field will only be displayed if the :guilabel:`Use Documents` field is selected on
the journal.

.. image:: brazil/journal-configuration.png
   :alt: Journal configuration with the Use Documents? field checked.

.. note::
   When creating the journal, ensure the field :guilabel:`Dedicated Credit Note Sequence` is
   unchecked, as in Brazil, sequences between invoices, credit notes, and debit notes are shared per
   series number, which means per journal.

Taxes
~~~~~

Taxes are automatically created when installing the Brazilian localization. Taxes are already
configured, and some of them are used by Avalara when computing taxes on the sales order or invoice.

Taxes can be edited, or more taxes can be added. For example, some taxes used for services need to
be manually added and configured, as the rate may differ depending on the city where you are
offering the service.

.. important::
   If you decide to do service taxes manually, you won't be able to issue an NFS-e. To
   electronically send an NFS-e, you need to compute taxes using Avalara.

.. warning::
   Do not delete taxes, as they are used for the AvaTax tax computation. If deleted, Odoo creates
   them again when used in an |SO| or invoice and computing taxes with AvaTax, but the account used
   to register the tax needs to be re-configured in the tax's :guilabel:`Definition` tab, under the
   :guilabel:`Distribution for invoices` and :guilabel:`Distribution for refunds` sections.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`Taxes functional documentation <../accounting/taxes>`

Workflows
=========

This section provides an overview of the actions that trigger `API calls
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API>`_ for tax computation, along with instructions on how to send
electronic invoices for goods (NF-e) and services (NFS-e) for government validation.

.. warning::
   Please note that each |API| call incurs a cost. Be mindful of the actions that trigger these
   calls to manage costs effectively.

Tax computation
---------------

Tax calculations on quotations and sales orders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trigger an |API| call to calculate taxes on a quotation or sales order automatically with AvaTax in
any of the following ways:

- **Quotation confirmation**
    Confirm a quotation into a sales order.
- **Manual trigger**
    Click on :guilabel:`Compute Taxes Using AvaTax`.
- **Preview**
    Click on the :guilabel:`Preview` button.
- **Email a quotation / sales order**
    Send a quotation or sales order to a customer via email.
- **Online quotation access**
    When a customer accesses the quotation online (via the portal view), the |API| call is
    triggered.

Tax calculations on invoices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trigger an |API| call to calculate taxes on a customer invoice automatically with AvaTax in any of
the following ways:

- **Manual trigger**
    Click on :guilabel:`Compute Taxes Using AvaTax`.
- **Preview**
    Click on the :guilabel:`Preview` button.
- **Online invoice access**
    When a customer accesses the invoice online (via the portal view), the |API| call is triggered.

.. note::
   The :guilabel:`Fiscal Position` must be set to `Automatic Tax Mapping (Avalara Brazil)` for any
   of these actions to compute taxes automatically.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`Fiscal positions (tax and account mapping) <../accounting/taxes/fiscal_positions>`

.. _brazil/electronic-documents:

Electronic documents
--------------------

Customer invoices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To process an electronic invoice for goods (NF-e) or services (NFS-e), the invoice needs to be
confirmed and taxes need to be computed by Avalara. Once that step is done, click on the
:guilabel:`Send & Print` button in the upper left corner. In the pop-up that appears, click on
:guilabel:`Process e-invoice` and any of the other options - :guilabel:`Download` or
:guilabel:`Email`. Finally, click on :guilabel:`Send & Print` to process the invoice with the
government.

Before sending the electronic invoice for goods (NF-e) or services (NFS-e), some fields need to be
filled out on the invoice:

- :guilabel:`Customer`, with all the customer information
- :guilabel:`Payment Method: Brazil`: how the invoice is planned to be paid
- :guilabel:`Fiscal Position` set as the :guilabel:`Automatic Tax Mapping (Avalara Brazil)`
- :guilabel:`Document Type` set as :guilabel:`(55) Electronic Invoice (NF-e)` or :guilabel:`(SE)
  Electronic Service Invoice (NFS-e)`

There are some other optional fields that depend on the nature of the transaction. These fields are
not required, so no errors will appear from the government if these optional fields are not
populated for most cases:

- :guilabel:`Freight Model` determines how the goods are planned to be transported - domestic
- :guilabel:`Transporter Brazil` determines who is doing the transportation

.. image:: brazil/invoice-info-needed.png
   :alt: Invoice information needed to process an electronic invoice.

.. image:: brazil/process-electronic-invoice.png
   :alt: Process electronic invoice pop-up in Odoo.

.. note::
   All of the fields available on the invoice used to issue an electronic invoice are also available
   on the sales order, if needed. When creating the first invoice, the field :guilabel:`Document
   Number` is displayed, allocated as the first number to be used sequentially for subsequent
   invoices.

Credit notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a sales return needs to be registered, then a credit note can be created in Odoo to be sent to
the government for validation.

.. note::
   Credit notes are only available for electronic invoices for goods (NF-e).

.. seealso::
   :ref:`Issue a credit note <accounting/issue-credit-note>`

Debit Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~

If additional information needs to be included, or values need to be corrected that were not
accurately provided in the original invoice, a debit note can be issued.

.. note::
   Debit notes are only available for electronic invoices for goods (NF-e).

   Only the products included in the original invoice can be part of the debit note. While changes
   can be made to the product's unit price or quantity, products **cannot** be added to the debit
   note. The purpose of this document is only to declare the amount that you want to add to the
   original invoice for the same or fewer products.

.. seealso::
   :ref:`Issue a debit note <accounting/issue-debit-note>`

Invoice cancellation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to cancel an electronic invoice that was validated by the government.

.. note::
   Check whether the electronic invoice is still within the cancellation deadline, which may vary
   according to the legislation of each state.

E-invoices for goods (NF-e)
***************************

Cancel an e-invoice for goods (NF-e) in Odoo by clicking :guilabel:`Request Cancel` and adding a
cancellation :guilabel:`Reason` on the pop-up that appears. If you want to send this cancellation
reason to the customer via email, activate the :guilabel:`E-mail` checkbox.

.. image:: brazil/invoice-cancellation.png
   :alt: Invoice cancellation reason in Odoo.

.. note::
   This is an electronic cancellation, which means that Odoo will send a request to the government
   to cancel the NF-e, and it will then consume one |IAP| credit, as an |API| call occurs.

E-invoices for services (NFS-e)
*******************************

Cancel an e-invoice for services (NFS-e) in Odoo by clicking :guilabel:`Request Cancel`. In this
case, there is no electronic cancellation process, as not every city has this service available. The
user needs to manually cancel this NFS-e on the city portal. Once that step is completed, they can
request the cancellation in Odoo, which will cancel the invoice.

Correction letter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A correction letter can be created and linked to an electronic invoice for goods (NF-e) that was
validated by the government.

This can be done in Odoo by clicking :guilabel:`Correction Letter` and adding a correction
:guilabel:`Reason` on the pop-up that appears. To send this correction reason to a customer via
email, activate the :guilabel:`E-mail` checkbox.

.. image:: brazil/correction-letter.png
   :alt: Correction letter reason in Odoo.

.. note::
   Correction letters are only available for electronic invoices for goods (NF-e).

Invalidate invoice number range
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A range of sequences that are assigned to sales journals can be invalidated with the government if
they are not currently used, **and** will not be used in the future. To do so, navigate to the
journal, and click the :menuselection:`âï¸ (gear) icon --> Invalidate Number Range (BR)`. On the
:guilabel:`Invalidate Number Range (BR)` wizard, add the :guilabel:`Initial Number` and
:guilabel:`End Number` of the range that should be cancelled, and enter an invalidation
:guilabel:`Reason`.

.. image:: brazil/range-number-invalidation.png
   :alt: Number range invalidation selection in Odoo.

.. image:: brazil/range-number-invalidation-wizard.png
   :alt: Number range invalidation wizard in Odoo.

.. note::
   Invalidate invoice number range documents are only available for electronic invoices for goods
   (NF-e).

.. note::
   The log of the cancelled numbers along with the XML file are recorded in the chatter of the
   journal.

Vendor bills
------------

On the vendor bills side, when receiving an invoice from a supplier, you can encode the bill in Odoo
by adding all the commercial information together with the same Brazilian specific information that
is recorded on the :ref:`customer invoices <brazil/electronic-documents>`.

These Brazilian specific fields are:

- :guilabel:`Payment Method: Brazil`: how the invoice is planned to be paid
- :guilabel:`Document Type`: used by your vendor
- :guilabel:`Document Number`: the invoice number from your supplier
- :guilabel:`Freight Model`: **NF-e specific** how goods are planned to be transported - domestic
- :guilabel:`Transporter Brazil`: **NF-e specific** who is doing the transportation.
