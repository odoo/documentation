==================================
Launch a Test and Start a Campaign
==================================
Before starting a campaign, launching a test allows you to run the workflow on a test contact and
view the sequence of events in action, avoiding mistakes.

Launch a test
=============
| Click on *Launch a test*.
| Once you have selected the test contact, *Run* the parent activity and the subsequent ones as
  needed.
  *Run* and *Stop* activities individually. To stop the whole workflow click on *Stop*.

.. note::
   Launching a test does not add data to your metrics with the purpose of not introducing wrong
   inputs to reports.


Start and stop a workflow
=========================
Click on *Start* to run the workflow, and on *Stop* to interrupt it. The interruption and new start
can happen at any moment. The current status will be shown on the status bar.

went/are/will go through, as well as when the workflow was triggered to him. If you wish to cancel
an activity click on *Cancel*.
