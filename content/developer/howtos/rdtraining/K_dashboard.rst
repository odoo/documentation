Advanced K: Dashboards
======================

.. warning::

    This tutorial assumes you have completed the :ref:`Core Training <howto/rdtraining>` and have
    access to Odoo Enterprise features.

    To follow the exercise, it is recommended that you fetch the branch
    14.0-core from the repository XXX, it
    contains a version of the module created during the core training we can use
    as a starting point.

The term "Dashboard" is used in Odoo for objects that display data, but involves different
implementations. This tutorial will only focus on the Enterprise view that is used to provide
aggregated data visualization. They can be added as a ``view_mode`` to an existing model (i.e. a
view you can switch to via the view buttons in the top right of a view), but they are also often
used as a view for to a special model customized for data visualization. You may hear these
special views referred to as SQL views.

It is useful to note there is a "Dashboard" app in Odoo Community. This app allows users to create
their own customized view of data, but the customization is only visible to each user and can
only be viewed within the "Dashboard" app. Technically it is possible to make global dashboards
using this ``board`` module, but it is much easier to do as an Enterprise view. Plus it looks nicer
and has extra features not available in ``board``. Some other dashboards within Odoo also exist,
but they are custom made and are beyond the scope of this tutorial.

The documentation related to this topic can be found in :ref:`reference/views/dashboard`.

File Structure
==============

You probably have already guessed that since dashboard views are an Enterprise view, they must have
a dependency on an Enterprise module. The Enterprise module is ``web_dashboard``. Don't forget to
add it to your manifest file! It is standard to add dashboards intended to be used as a
``view_mode`` for one of your module's models (in the ``model`` folder``) to the views directory
(i.e. the same file that contains the other views for the same model).

It is standard to create a separate Enterprise module to add extra Enterprise views and features to
a Community module. This is done in a similar manner as the module link technique covered within
:ref:`howto/rdtraining/14_other_module`. The difference is that instead of linking 2 different
modules, we are extending our `estate` module. We do this by creating a new module and adding both
the Community module and its necessary Enterprise module dependencies to its manifest. You will
commonly see "enterprise" in the module's directory name. To keep this tutorial simple, we will
add dashboards to our existing ``estate`` module.

SQL Views have 2 parts: their xml file (don't forget to add it to your manifest file) and their
Python file (don't forget to add it to the appropriate ``__init.py__`` files). The former is the
same format as the ``view_mode`` xml while the latter contains a custom model and SQL code to
populate its fields. It is standard to add SQL view files to the ``report/`` directory. It
is also common to include "report" in the name of the SQL view's files. You may be
wondering why do we put the files in a report directory? We saw earlier that the dashboard is
for data visualization, therefore it is not editable. You can think of dashboards as interactive
reports where you can click on statistics, graphs, and charts to see the specific data contributing
to them. Note it is also standard to store the xml code for
:ref:`PDF report templates <howto/rdtraining/J_reports>` in the report directory.

It is expected that your work tree will look something like:

.. code-block:: bash

  estate
  ├── models
  │   ├── *.py
  │   └── __init__.py
  ├── report
  │   ├── __init__.py
  │   ├── estate_report.py
  │   └── estate_report_views.xml
  ├── security
  │   └── ir.model.access.csv
  ├── views
  │   ├── *.xml
  │   └── estate_property_views.xml
  ├── __init__.py
  └── __manifest__.py

Dashboard View
==============

.. note::

    **Goal**: at the end of this section, we will have a new dashboard view that displays
    different property statistics.

    .. image:: K_dashboard/simple_dashboard.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Basic Dashboard view

Dashboards can display data in different ways, including:

* showing an ``aggregate`` of a field
* using aggregated fields in a ``formula``
* using a ``widget``
* using another ``view`` as a subview

There are many useful statistics and visuals we can provide for our real estate example using
these options. A full example to reference while doing the exercises in this section is
`viewable here <https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/blob/6fd3244ae168dc73c348a9c1870796e89d8ef594/crm_enterprise/views/crm_lead_views.xml#L106-L133>`__
(restricted github repository link).

Data
----
To fully enjoy our dashboard view, we will need good test data to populate it. Test data will
allow us to check that the resulting look and statistics are correct. It is a good idea to test
with data that will cover most or all of your expected use cases, but is also easy to verify with
that your statistics are correct. In our goal's case we are looking at count, sum, average,
minimum, and maximum statistics, therefore a good representation set for our dashboard is:

* At least 3 properties with different property types, expected prices, and average living area.
* At least 1 sold property and at least 1 canceled property

If you don't have a set of data like this already, you can either:

* Complete :ref:`howto/rdtraining/C_data` (if you haven't done so already) and add the extra
  cases to your demo data (you may need to create a new database to load in the demo data).
* Manually create the data in your database.
* Copy this `data file <https://github.com/odoo/technical-training-solutions/blob/14.0-K_dashboard/estate/data/estate_demo.xml>`__
  into a new directory called ``data`` in your estate module and copy
  `these lines <https://github.com/odoo/technical-training-solutions/blob/14.0-K_dashboard/estate/__manifest__.py#L21-L23>`__
  into your __manifest__.py file (you may need to create a new database to load in the demo data).

Click through your database data and make sure it is what you expect. Of course you can add the
data after you write your dashboard code and then test that your view is working as expected.

Aggregations
------------
Building a dashboard view is very similar to what you have previously done in
:ref:`howto/rdtraining/07_basicviews`. For the dashboard view, we use the `dashboard` root element
and choose from its possible tags (see all the possibilities and their attributes in the
:ref:`reference/views/dashboard` documentation). So a simple dashboard example is:

.. code-block:: xml

    <dashboard>
        <group>
            <aggregate name="min_expected_price" string="Min Expected Price" field="expected_price"
                group_operator="min" help="Lowest expected price."/>
        </group>
    </dashboard>

In this example, ``<group>`` adds styling and ``<aggregate>`` declares an aggregation. We
indicate which ``field`` we want to aggregate, what ``string`` to display with the value, and
how to aggregate it with the `group_operator` attribute. The `group_operator` can use any valid
PostgreSQL aggregate function plus the special Odoo defined ``count_distinct``.

Hopefully you remember how to add views to a window action `view_mode` (hint, it was
covered in :ref:`howto/rdtraining/06_firstui`). Now let's make some dashboards!

.. exercise:: Make a dashboard view.

    - Create a dashboard of aggregated values for the ``estate.property`` model. You can
      look at the **Goal** of this section for some inspiration. Remember to check that your
      statistics are calculating as you expect and note that the calculated values take into
      consideration any applied view filters!

    - Bonus: Add in some aggregations that need a `domain` to make sense (remember domains were
      also covered in :ref:`howto/rdtraining/07_basicviews`).

Pie Charts
----------
Adding pie charts to dashboards is a piece of cake using the `<widget>` element. An example is:

.. code-block:: xml

    <dashboard>
        <group>
          <widget name="pie_chart" title="Property Types" attrs="{'groupby': 'property_type_id'}"/>
        </group>
    </dashboard>

In this example, we indicate that we're using the `pie_chart` widget with the `name` attribute,
the ``title`` for the pie chart, and that we're grouping it by property type.

.. exercise:: Add some pie charts.

    - Add the pie charts from the **Goal** of this section to your dashboard. Hint: you will need
      to add `'measure': selling_price` to your pie chart `attrs` if you want to show selling
      prices grouped by property type.

    - Hover over and click on the pie charts to check your charts counts values and don't forget
      that filters will also apply to the charts.

    - Bonus: Add a domain to your selling price pie chart to only include "sold" properties (i.e.
      not "offer_accepted" ones). Note that the `'` will need to be escaped since it is declared
      as part of the `attrs`.

Subviews
--------
Similar to how we can use the list view within the form view (we saw this automatically happen for
One2many relationships in :ref:`howto/rdtraining/08_relations`), we can add other views within our
dashboard view. The most commonly added are the pivot and graph views, but the cohort view is
also an option. These views are covered in more depth in :ref:`howto/rdtraining/H_adv_views`. For
this topic you are only required to know their names. A dashboard with only subviews is:

.. code-block:: xml

    <dashboard>
        <view type="graph"/>
        <view type="pivot"/>
    </dashboard>

The `ref` attribute can be added to `<view>` elements to use a specific xml id for that view. If
no xml id is provided for a graph or pivot view then the default view will be used.
The cohort view will not work in the dashboard without a specific xml id. If you have already
created some of these views then you are welcome to add them to your dashboard! Sample graph and
pivot views are included in the
`solution code <https://github.com/odoo/technical-training-solutions/blob/14.0-K_dashboard/estate/views/estate_property_views.xml#L169-L191>`__
that you are welcome to use as well.

.. exercise:: Add subviews.

    - Add in a graph and a pivot view to your dashboard. Try playing around with the layout of
      your subviews in relation to your pie charts and aggregated values and refer to the **Goal**
      of this section for an often used layout. Remember to check that your subviews are
      displaying your data as expected (and yes, they are also affected by the filters!).

SQL Views
=========

.. warning::

    This section expects you to have a basic knowledge of SQL. If you have little to no SQL
    knowledge then `this is a good tutorial to start with <https://selectstarsql.com/>`__
    and these `exercises <https://www.pgexercises.com/>`__ are good for those who need
    a refresher or extra practice.

.. note::

    **Goal**: at the end of this section, we will have a new SQL view that displays different
    property statistics.

    .. image:: K_dashboard/report_dashboard.png
      :align: center
      :alt: SQL view


Occasionally we want to show data that goes beyond what our model already has in it. We could add
a lot of stored computed or related fields (non-stored fields cannot be aggregated
or displayed in pie charts), but it would be impractical to store a bunch of fields only for this
purpose. We can instead add a custom SQL view to minimize the computational load and keep our
model clean of unnecessary fields.

Model
-----
We will start with the more difficult part: our special report model. This file starts the same as
any other model except that we add 2 attributes ``_auto`` and ``_rec_name``::

  from odoo import fields, models, tools


  class EstateReport(models.Model):
      _name = 'estate.report'
      _description = "Stock Report"
      _rec_name = 'id'
      _auto = False

``_auto = False`` indicates that we do not want to store the model in the database and we will
create a custom table by overriding the ``BaseModel.init()`` method. ``_rec_name`` indicates
which of the model's fields represents a record's name (i.e. the name that will be used in the
navigation breadcrumb when opening a record's form view). In this case I left it as 'id' because
our property offers don't have a name. We will need the `tools` import later (i.e.
``odoo/odoo/tools``, which is full of all sort of useful helper methods you will probably use in
the future). Note that it is standard to include ``report`` in the model name.

Remember your new model will need to be added to your security file like you learned in
:ref:`howto/rdtraining/05_securityintro`!

Then we define the fields we need for our dashboard the same way as any other model (like you
learned in :ref:`howto/rdtraining/04_basicmodel`), except that every field is
``readonly=True``. After all, our model is for readonly purposes only.

Now we override the ``BaseModel.init()`` method mentioned earlier::

  def init(self):
      tools.drop_view_if_exists(self.env.cr, self._table)
      self.env.cr.execute("""CREATE or REPLACE VIEW %s as (
                             SELECT
                                %s
                             FROM
                                %s
            )""" % (self._table, self._select(), self._from()))

We use ``tools.drop_view_if_exists`` to ensure that we don't create a conflicting view and then
execute the SQL query. It is standard to separate the different parts of the query to
allow for easier model extension. Exactly how the query is split up across methods is not
standardized, but you will often see at minimum ``_select`` and ``_from`` methods [or something
similar] and of course all of these methods will return strings. The columns from the SELECT
will populate our model's fields so ensure that your column names match your field names
or use alias names that match.

.. exercise:: Create report model.

    - Create a report model with the following fields:

      ========================= ========================= =========================
      Field                     Type                      Note
      ========================= ========================= =========================
      id                        Integer                   Corresponds to ``id`` of ``estate.property.offer``
      offer_state               Selection                 Equals ``state`` choices of ``estate.property.offer``
      property_id               Many2one                  ``estate.property``
      property_state            Selection                 Equals ``state`` choices of ``estate.property``
      property_type_id          Many2one                  ``estate.property.type``
      ========================= ========================= =========================

      and write the SQL query necessary to populate the fields (hint, you will need 2 JOINs).

      You won't be able to check if your model is correct until we create a view for it, but you are
      welcome to check your query directly in your database to see if the results are as you expect.
      If you struggle with this exercise, then
      `here is an example <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/7417d8fc138b9de550bc631435bcc08628c29bed/addons/crm/report/crm_activity_report.py>`__
      to reference.

View
----
Now that we have our model, we can make its dashboard view. There is no difference to how its made
except that its file is located in the ``report`` folder. Since it is a new model not linked to
any other model, we will also have to add a new menuitem to view our dashboard. Typically SQL views
are added under a first level menu called ``Reporting` (because it's a report, surprise!). Do you
remember how to add a ``menuitem``? If not, revisit :ref:`howto/rdtraining/06_firstui`) again.

.. exercise:: Create report view.

    - Recreate the dashboard in the **Goal** of this section. Hint: it uses the ``formula`` element,
      which we did not need for our previous dashboard.

    - Bonus: Create ``list`` and ``form`` views for your new report model so we don't have to see the ugly
      defaults when you click on your pie charts.

Extra Tips
----------
**Tip 1** A common mistake in SQL views is to not take into account the duplication of certain data
due to table JOINs. For example, in our **Goal** we have a pie chart of the offers' property types.
We may be tempted to add a similar pie chart with a domain to only include canceled properties,
so we think we are only counting the number of canceled properties by property type. In reality we
are still looking at all the offers per property so any property with more than 1 offer will be
counted per offer. This example is easily double checked by clicking on the pie chart to see its
list view:

    .. image:: K_dashboard/report_list_detail.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Pie chart list view

But for cases such as average aggregations or using a subview such as the pivot view, it is easy to
miss this mistake. It is also easy to miss this mistake when you have insufficient test data.
In order to add a number of properties canceled by property type pie chart to this
report, we would either have to do a hack (too advanced for this tutorial) or simply exclude it
from this report.

**Tip 2** If you have a field that you do not want as a measure (i.e. in your pivot or
graph views), then you can add ``store=False`` to it and it will not show.
