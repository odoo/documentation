How to process incoming receipts?
=================================

There are two approaches to process incoming receipts: you can either
work on printed documents (and scan lines on the documents), or on a
screen (and scan products directly).

Process printed incoming receipts:
==================================

-   Print incoming receipts of the day by selecting all documents from
    the **To Receive** list and print **Picking Operations** from the top
    menu.

-   Once you start processing your incoming receipts, scan the barcode on
    the top-right corner of the document to load the right record on
    the screen.

-   Then, scan the barcode of every product, or scan the barcode of the
    product on the picking line if the barcode on the product is not
    easily accessible, visible or is missing.

-   Once you scanned all products, scan the **Validate** barcode action to
    finish the operation.

Process incoming receipts from a computer or mobile device:
===========================================================

-   Load all the incoming receipts marked as **To Receive**, and open the
    first one.

-   Pick up and scan each listed product.

-   When you've picked all the items, click the **Validate** button or scan
    the **Validate** barcode action to finish the Operation.

-   Move to the next incoming receipt to process by clicking on the
    top-right right **arrow** or scanning the **Pager-Next** barcode action.
