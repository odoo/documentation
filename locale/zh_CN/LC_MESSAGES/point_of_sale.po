" applications expect to be able to write to certain directories though. So "
"we provide a ramdisk for /etc and /var (Raspbian automatically provides one "
"for /tmp). These ramdisks are setup by ``setup_ramdisks.sh``, which we run "
"before all other init scripts by running it in ``/etc/init.d/rcS``. The "
"ramdisks are named /etc_ram and /var_ram respectively. Most data from /etc "
"and /var is copied to these tmpfs ramdisks. In order to restrict the size of"
" the ramdisks, we do not copy over certain things to them (eg. apt related "
"data). We then bind mount them over the original directories. So when an "
"application writes to /etc/foo/bar it's actually writing to "
"/etc_ram/foo/bar. We also bind mount / to /root_bypass_ramdisks to be able "
