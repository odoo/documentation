Work with Mailing Lists

Mailing lists can be a goldmine for your companyâ€™s marketing department as they can provide leads
for sales, focus groups for testing new products, and consumers to provide feedback on satisfaction,
for example.

Create mailing lists
====================

Go to :menuselection:`Mailing lists --> Mailing lists --> Create`. Enable the option *Is Public* to
make the list visible for users when unsubscribing.

Once your mailing list is created, you can manually add contacts clicking on *Create*. *Import* a
list of contacts if you have it from a previous tool.

-------------------------------------

| Create a mailing list called Newsletter, as you use this strategy to advertise and communicate new
  ideas to subscribers interested in listening.
