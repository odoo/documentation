==================================
Settings
==================================

Overview
========

The settings allow you to manage the configuration of your project.

Project name
============

The name of your project.

.. image:: ./media/interface-settings-projectname.png
   :align: center

This is the domain that will be used to access your production database.

The domain to access your staging and development builds will contain this name as well.
However, when you change your project name, only future builds will use the new name.

Collaborators
=============

Manage the Github users who can access your project.

.. image:: ./media/interface-settings-collaborators.png
   :align: center

There are two levels of users:

* Admin: has access to all features of Odoo.sh.
* User: does not have access to the project settings nor to the production and staging databases.

The user group is meant for developers who can make modifications in your code but are not allowed to access the
production data.
Users of this group cannot connect to the production and staging databases using the *1-click connect* feature,
but they can of course use their regular account on these databases if they have one, using their regular credentials.

In addition, they cannot use the webshell nor have access to the server logs.

Public Access
=============

Allow public access to your development builds.

.. image:: ./media/interface-settings-public.png
   :align: center

Expose the Builds page publicly, allowing visitors to connect to your development builds.

In addition, visitors have access to the logs, shell and mails of your development builds.

Production and staging builds are excluded, visitors can only see their status.

Modules installation
====================

Choose the modules to install automatically for your development builds.

.. image:: ./media/interface-settings-modulesinstallation.png
   :align: center

* *Install only my modules* will install the modules of the branch only.
  The ` submodules <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules>`_ are excluded.
* *Full installation (all modules)* will install the modules of the branch, the modules included in the submodules
  and all standard modules of Odoo.
* *Install a list of modules* will install the modules specified in the input just below this option.
  The names are the technical name of the modules, and they must be comma-separated.

All installed modules will be tested.
The tests in the standard Odoo modules suite can take up to 1 hour.
This setting applies to development builds only.
Staging builds duplicate the production build and the production build only installs base.

Custom domains
==============

Configure your own domain name.

.. image:: ./media/interface-settings-customdomains.png
   :align: center

If you would like to access your production database using your own domain name, you have to:

* own or purchase the domain name,
* add the domain name in this list,
* in your domain name manager,
  configure the domain name with a CNAME record set to your production database domain name.

For instance, to associate *www.mycompany.com* to your database *mycompany.odoo.com*:

* in Odoo.sh, add *www.mycompany.com* in the custom domains of your project settings,
* in your domain name manager (e.g. *godaddy.com*, *gandi.net*, *ovh.com*),
  configure *www.mycompany.com* with a CNAME record with as value *mycompany.odoo.com*.

Bare domains (e.g. *mycompany.com*) are not accepted:

* they can only be configured using A records,
* A records only accept IP addresses as value,
* the IP address of your database can change, following an upgrade, an hardware failure or
  your wish to host your database in another country or continent.

Therefore, bare domains could suddenly no longer work because of this change of IP address.

In addition, if you would like both *mycompany.com* and *www.mycompany.com* to work with your database,
having the first redirecting to the second is amongst the
`SEO best practices <https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184?hl=en>`_
(See *Provide one version of a URL to reach a document*)
in order to have one dominant URL. You can therefore just configure *mycompany.com* to redirect to *www.mycompany.com*.
Most domain managers have the feature to configure this redirection. This is commonly called a web redirection.

HTTPS/SSL
---------

You can use a third-party CDN such as *Cloudflare.com* to enable the *HTTPS* support for your custom domain:

* `Create a Cloudflare account <https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/201720164-Step-2-Create-a-Cloudflare-account-and-add-a-website>`_
* `Change your domain name servers to Cloudflare <https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/205195708-Step-3-Change-your-domain-name-servers-to-Cloudflare>`_
* `Choose an SSL mode <https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/201897700-Step-4-Recommended-First-Steps-for-all-Cloudflare-users#sslmode>`_
* `Redirect your visitors to HTTPS <https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170536-How-do-I-redirect-all-visitors-to-HTTPS-SSL->`_

Submodules
==========

Configure the deploy keys for the private repositories you use
as submodules in your branches to allow Odoo.sh to download them.

.. Warning::
  These settings are required for **private repositories** only.
  If you are looking on how to set up your submodules,
  instructions are available in the chapter `Submodules <../advanced/submodules.html>`_ of this documentation.

.. image:: ./media/interface-settings-submodules.png
   :align: center

When a repository is private, this is not possible to publicly download its branches and revisions.
For that reason, you need to configure a deploy key for Odoo.sh,
so the git server allows our platform to download the revisions
of this private repository.

To configure the deploy key for a private repository, proceed as follow:

* in the input, paste the SSH URL of your private sub-repository and click on *Add*,

  * e.g. *git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git*
  * it can be another git server than Github, such as Bitbucket, Gitlab or even your own self-hosted server

* copy the public key,

  * it should look like *ssh-rsa some...random...characters...here...==*

* in the settings of the private sub-repository, add the public key amongst the deploy keys.

  * Github.com: Settings > Deploy keys > Add deploy key
  * Bitbucket.com: Settings > Access keys > Add key
  * Gitlab.com: Settings > Repository > Deploy Keys
  * Self-hosted: append the key to the git userâ€™s authorized_keys file in its .ssh directory
