These scripts will update Raspbian, remove non-essential packages and install required packages. In order to boot Raspbian we use qemu, which is capable of providing ARM emulation. After this, the emulated Raspbian OS will shut itself down.

The resulting image is then ready to be tested and used."

It also ensures that the filesystem cannot be corrupted by cutting the power to the POSBox. Linux applications expect to be able to write to certain directories though. So we provide a ramdisk for /etc and /var (Raspbian automatically provides one for /tmp). These ramdisks are setup by ``setup_ramdisks.sh``, which we run before all other init scripts by running it in ``/etc/init.d/rcS``. The ramdisks are named /etc_ram and /var_ram respectively. Most data from /etc and /var is copied to these tmpfs ramdisks. In order to restrict the size of the ramdisks, we do not copy over certain things to them (eg. apt related data). We then bind mount them over the original directories. So when an application writes to /etc/foo/bar it's actually writing to /etc_ram/foo/bar. We also bind mount / to /root_bypass_ramdisks to be able to get to the real /etc and /var during development."
