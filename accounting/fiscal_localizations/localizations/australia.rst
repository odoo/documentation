KeyPay Australian Payroll
=========================

The KeyPay Module synchronizes payslip accounting entries (e.g., expenses, social charges,
liabilities, taxes) from KeyPay to Odoo automatically. Payroll administration is still done in
KeyPay. We only record the journal entries in Odoo.

Configuration Steps
-------------------

#. Create a company located in Australia.
#. Check that the Australian localization module (Australia - Accounting) is installed.
#. Configure the *KeyPay API*.

   change it.*

#. You can choose any Odoo journal to post the payslip entries.

How does the API work?
----------------------

The API syncs the journal entries from KeyPay to Odoo and leaves them in draft mode. The reference
includes the KeyPay payslip entry ID in brackets for the user to easily retrieve the same record in
KeyPay and Odoo.

.. note::
   The API sync is triggered by scheduled actions.

KeyPay payslip entries also work based on double-entry bookkeeping. Debit must equal credit (like in
Odoo).

The accounts used by KeyPay are defined in the section **Payroll settings**.

For the API to work, you need to create the same accounts as the default accounts of your KeyPay
business (**same name and same code**) in Odoo. You also need to choose the correct account types in
Odoo to generate accurate financial reports.
