How to accept paypal payments on invoices?
==========================================

The "Paypal Payment Acquirer" module allows you to accept payments via
paypal, for your sales orders, invoices, or online orders. As paypal
accepts payments through credit cards (VISA, Mastercard, â€¦), you will be
able to process most payment methods.

Paypal support two modes:

- Paypal Merchant Account: the user is redirected to paypal to do the
  payment (either with a credit card or a paypal account)

- PayPal PayFlow Pro (S2S, Server 2 Server): the user is not redirected
  to paypal and the payment can be done in the background. This
  method is mostly used for subscription businesses where you need
  to charge your customers periodically.

As of today, Odoo only support the normal Paypal Merchant Account.

Configuration
=============

Install the "PayPal Payment Acquirer" module
--------------------------------------------

Start by installing the **PayPal Payment Acquirer** module.

Once the module is installed, you should see a new payment acquirer in
the Setting application, menu "Payment Acquirers".

By default, Paypal is configured to work in a test environment,
out-of-the-box. It means you can already test the full order to payment
flow with the paypal sandbox, without having to configure the next
steps.

6. If you want your customers to be able to pay through Paypal
   while not having a Paypal account- following setting "Paypal Account
   Optional" needs to be set to **ON**. All users will be able to
   choose Credit/debit card payment option - Paypal account not
   required.

Troubleshooting
===============

If your eCommerce customer gets this Error Message after completing
Paypal payment instead of being redirected to your database:

.. image:: ./media/paypal16.png

Verify the Auto Return URL you have `configured in Paypal <WebsitePreferences_>`_
is correct and pointing to your own domain name.

You can either:

* Enter the correct return URL and activate Auto Return

* or deactivate Auto Return and delete URL (this method will have an
  extra click through Paypal in order to return to your ecommerce
  page.)
