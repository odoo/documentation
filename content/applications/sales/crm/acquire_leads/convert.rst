Convert leads into opportunities
================================

The system can generate leads instead of opportunities, in order to add
a qualification step before converting a *Lead* into an
*Opportunity* and assigning to the right sales people. You can
activate this mode from the CRM Settings. It applies to all your sales
channels by default. But you can make it specific for specific channels
from their configuration form.

Configuration
=============

For this feature to work, go to :menuselection:`CRM --> Configuration --> Settings`
and activate the *Leads* feature.

You will now have a new submenu *Leads* under *Leads* where they
will aggregate.

Convert a lead into an opportunity
==================================

When you click on a *Lead* you will have the option to convert it to
an opportunity and decide if it should still be assigned to the same
channel/person and if you need to create a new customer.

If you already have an opportunity with that customer Odoo will
automatically offer you to merge with that opportunity. In the same
manner, Odoo will automatically offer you to link to an existing
customer if that customer already exists.
