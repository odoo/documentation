Where to find help?
===================


Odoo Enterprise
===============

Users who have a valid Odoo Enterprise subscription may always contact our support teams through our
`support form <https://www.odoo.com/help>`_, no matter the hosting type you chose (Odoo Online,
Odoo.sh or on your own server).

Please include in your request:

- your subscription number
- the URL of your database if your database is hosted by Odoo (Odoo Online or Odoo.sh)

Our agents will get back to you as soon as possible.


Odoo Community
==============

*Odoo Community users don't get access to the support service.*

Here are some resources that might help you:

- Our `documentation pages <https://www.odoo.com/page/docs>`_.
- Ask your question on the `community forum <https://www.odoo.com/forum/help-1>`_.
- `Buy Odoo Enterprise <https://www.odoo.com/documentation/13.0/setup/enterprise.html>`_ to get the
  support and bugfix services.
