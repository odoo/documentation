Bank synchronization
====================

Odoo can synchronize directly with your bank institution to get all bank statements imported
automatically into your database.

To check if your bank is compatible with Odoo, go to `Odoo Accounting Features
<https://www.odoo.com/page/accounting-features>`_, and click on
:guilabel:`See list of supported institutions`.

Odoo supports more than 25,000 institutions around the world.

To connect to the banks, Odoo uses multiple web-services:

- **Plaid**: United States of America and Canada
- **Yodlee**: Worldwide
- :doc:`Salt Edge <bank_synchronization/saltedge>`: Worldwide
- :doc:`Ponto <bank_synchronization/ponto>`: Europe
- :doc:`Enable Banking <bank_synchronization/enablebanking>`: Scandinavian countries

.. seealso::
   :doc:`transactions`

Configuration
=============

On-Premise users
----------------

To be able to use this service, you need to have a valid Odoo Enterprise subscription.
So make sure that your database is registered with your Odoo Enterprise contract.
We also use a proxy between your database and the third party provider so, in case of
a connection error, please check that you don't have a firewall or a proxy blocking the
following address:

- https://production.odoofin.com/

First synchronization
---------------------

You can start synchronization either by going to the Accounting app and
:menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Add a Bank Account`.

Now you can search for your bank institution. Select it and follow the steps to synchronize with it.

.. note::
   If you have any issues during your first synchronization, please verify that your
   web browser doesn't block pop-ups and that your ad-blocker is disabled.

.. important::
   When setting up the bank statement synchronization, Odoo automatically starts recording the
   accounting transactions from the last transactionâ€™s date +1 day (if the last transaction day is
   31/12/2022, the recording starts on 01/01/2023). If the journal contains no transaction, Odoo
   retrieves transactions as far back as possible. You can limit how far back Odoo retrieves
   transactions by opening the Accounting app, going to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Lock Dates`,
   and setting a date in the :guilabel:`Journal Entries Lock Date` field.

You must provide a phone number during your first synchronization to secure your account. We ask for
such information because we don't want your data falling into the wrong hands. Therefore, if we
detect suspicious activities on your account, we block all requests coming from your account, and
you need to reactivate it using that phone number.

The third-party provider may request more information in order to connect with your bank
institution. This information is not stored on Odoo's servers.

By default, transactions fetched from an online source are grouped inside the same statement, and
one bank statement is created per month. You can change the bank statement creation periodicity
in your journal settings.

To view all your synchronizations, activate the :ref:`developer mode <developer-mode>` and go to
:menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Online Synchronization`.

Synchronize manually
--------------------

After your first synchronization, the created journals are synchronized by default every 12 hours.
If you wish, you can synchronize them manually by clicking on the :guilabel:`Synchronize Now` button
on the dashboard.

Alternatively, activate the :ref:`developer mode <developer-mode>`, go to
:menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Online Synchronization`, select your institution,
and then click the :guilabel:`Fetch transactions` button.

.. important::
   Some institutions do not allow transactions to be fetched automatically. For such institutions,
   during the automatic synchronization of the account, you receive an error message asking you to
   disable the automatic synchronization. This message can be found in the chatter of your online
   synchronizations. In this case, make sure to perform manual synchronizations.

Issues
======

Synchronization in error
------------------------

To report a connection error to the `Odoo support <https://www.odoo.com/help>`_, activate the
:ref:`developer mode <developer-mode>`, go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration -->
Online Synchronization`, select the connection that failed, and copy the error description and the
reference.

Synchronization disconnected
----------------------------

If your connection with the proxy is disconnected, you can reconnect with the proxy using the
:guilabel:`Fetch Account` button.

.. note::
   If you are unable to reconnect using the :guilabel:`Reconnect` button, please contact the
   `support <https://www.odoo.com/help>`_ directly with your client id or the reference of the error
   listed in the chatter.

Migration process for users having installed Odoo before December 2020
======================================================================

If you are on-premise, please first make sure that your source is up-to-date with the latest version
of Odoo.

Users who have created a database before December 2020 need to install the new module manually to
use the new functionalities.

To do so, go to :menuselection:`Apps --> Update Apps List`, remove the default filter in the search
bar and type `account_online_synchronization`. You can then click on :guilabel:`Install`.
Finally, make sure all your users refresh their Odoo page by pressing CTRL+F5.

.. Note::

   - All previous synchronizations are disconnected during the installation and will not work
     anymore. To view them, activate the :ref:`developer mode <developer-mode>` and go to
     :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Online Synchronization`). It is not possible
     to resynchronize these connections; you have to make new ones.
   - Do not uninstall the `account_online_sync` module, which is the previous module for online
     synchronization. The new one overrides it.
   - By default, the `account_online_synchronization` module is installed automatically with
     Accounting.

FAQ
===

The synchronization is not working in real-time. Is that normal?
----------------------------------------------------------------

The process is not intended to work in real-time as third party providers synchronize your accounts
at different intervals. To force the synchronization and fetch the statements, go to your
:guilabel:`Accounting Dashboard`, and click on the :guilabel:`Synchronize Now` button. Synchronize
and fetch transactions by activating the :ref:`developer mode <developer-mode>` and going to
:menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Online Synchronization`. Some providers only allow
one refresh per day, so it is possible that clicking on :guilabel:`Synchronize Now` does not get
your latest transactions if you already performed such action earlier in the day.

A transaction can be visible on your bank account but not be fetched if it has the status
:guilabel:`Pending`. Only transactions with the :guilabel:`Posted` status will be retrieved. If the
transaction is not **Posted** yet, you will have to wait until the status changes.

Is the Online Bank Synchronization feature included in my contract?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

- **Community Edition**: No, this feature is not included in the Community Version.
- **Online Edition**: Yes, even if you benefit from the One App Free contract.
- **Enterprise Edition**: Yes, if you have a valid enterprise contract linked to your database.

Some banks have a status "Beta." What does this mean?
-----------------------------------------------------

This means that banking institutions are not yet fully supported by our Third Party Provider. Bugs
or other problems may arise. Odoo does not support technical problems that occur with banks in the
Beta phase, but the user may still choose to connect. Connecting with these banks contributes to the
development process since the Provider will have real data and feedback from the connection.

Why do my transactions only synchronize when I refresh manually?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Some banks have additional security measures and require extra steps, such as an SMS/email
authentication code or another type of MFA. Because of this, the integrator cannot pull transactions
until the security code is provided.

Not all of my past transactions are in Odoo, why?
-------------------------------------------------

For some institutions, transactions can only be fetched up to 3 months in the past.

Why don't I see any transactions?
---------------------------------

During your first synchronization, you selected the bank accounts you decided to synchronize with
Odoo. If you didn't synchronize any of your accounts, activate the :ref:`developer mode
<developer-mode>`, go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Online Synchronization`,
and click the :guilabel:`Fetch Account` button on the connection.

There may also be no new transactions.

If your bank account is properly linked to a journal and posted transactions are not visible in your
database, please `submit a support ticket <https://www.odoo.com/help>`_.

How can I update my bank credentials?
-------------------------------------

To update your credentials, activate the :ref:`developer mode <developer-mode>` and go to
:menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Online Synchronization`. Open the connection you
want to update your credentials and click the :guilabel:`Update Credentials` button.
