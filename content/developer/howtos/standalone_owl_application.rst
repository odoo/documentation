Create a standalone Owl application
===================================

For any number of reasons, you may want to have a standalone Owl application that isn't a part of
the web client. One example in Odoo is the self-ordering application, that lets customers order
food from their phone. In this chapter we will go into what's required to achieve something like this.

Overview
========

To have a standalone Owl app, a few things are required:

- a root component for the application
- some setup code to start the services and mount the component
- an assets bundle that contains the setup code
- a QWeb view that calls the assets bundle
- a controller that renders the view

1. Root component
=================

To keep things simple, let's start with a very straightforward component that just renders
"Hello, World!". This will let us know at a glance if our setup is working.

First, create the template in :file:`/your_module/static/src/standalone_app/root.xml`.

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <templates xml:space="preserve">
        <t t-name="your_module.Root">
            Hello, World!
        </t>
    </templates>

Then create the JavaScript file for that component in :file:`/your_module/static/src/standalone_app/root.js`.

.. code-block:: js

    /** @odoo-module */
    import { Component } from "@odoo/owl";

    export class Root extends Component {
        static template = "your_module.Root";
        static props = {};
    }

.. seealso::
   :ref:`Owl components reference<frontend/components>`.

2. Setting up the environment and mounting the application
==========================================================

An Owl application needs an environment, and the Odoo JavaScript framework needs that environment to
contain the :ref:`services<frontend/services>`.
Starting the services is also required to load the translations, which we need to do before mounting
our Owl application, so that we can give Owl a working translation function.

Create the JavaScript file that will mount the app in :file:`/your_module/static/src/standalone_app/app.js`.

.. code-block:: js

    /** @odoo-module */
    import { whenReady } from "@odoo/owl";
    import { mountComponent } from "@web/env";
    import { Root } from "./root";

    whenReady(() => mountComponent(Root, document.body));


3. Creating an assets bundle containing our code
================================================

In the manifest of your module, create a new :ref:`assets bundle<reference/assets_bundle>`.
It should include the `web._assets_core` bundle, which contains the Odoo JavaScript
framework and the core libraries it needs (e.g. Owl and luxon), after which you can have a
glob that adds all the files for your application in the bundle.

.. code-block:: py
    :emphasize-lines: 9-10

    {
        # ...
        'assets': {
            'your_module.assets_standalone_app': [
                ('include', 'web._assets_helpers'),
                'web/static/src/scss/pre_variables.scss',
                'web/static/lib/bootstrap/scss/_variables.scss',
                ('include', 'web._assets_bootstrap'),
                ('include', 'web._assets_core'),
                'your_module/static/src/standalone_app/**/*',
            ],
        }
    }

The other lines are bundles and scss files that are required to make Bootstrap work. They are
mandatory, as the components of the web framework use bootstrap classes for their styling and
layout.

.. caution::
    Make sure that the files for your standalone app are only added to this bundle, if you already
    have a definition for `web.assets_backend` or `web.assets_frontend` and they have globs, make
    sure these globs don't match the files for your standalone app, otherwise the startup code for
    your app will conflict with the existing startup code in those bundles.

.. seealso::
    :ref:`Module manifest reference<reference/module/manifest>`.

4. XML view that calls the assets bundle
========================================

Now that we have created our assets bundle, we need to create a
:ref:`QWeb view<reference/view_architecture/qweb>` that uses that assets bundle.

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <odoo>
        <template id="your_module.standalone_app">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
            <html>
                <head>
                    <script type="text/javascript">
                        var odoo = {
                            csrf_token: "<t t-nocache="The csrf token must always be up to date." t-esc="request.csrf_token(None)"/>",
                            debug: "<t t-out="debug"/>",
                            __session_info__: <t t-esc="json.dumps(session_info)"/>,
                        };
                    </script>
                    <t t-call-assets="your_module.assets_standalone_app" />
                </head>
                <body/>
            </html>
        </template>
    </odoo>

This template only does two things: it initializes the `odoo` global variable, then calls the assets
bundle we just defined. Initializing the `odoo` global variable is a necessary step. This variable
should be an object that contains the following:

- The CSRF token, which is required to interact with HTTP controllers in many cases.
- The debug value, which is used in many places to add additional logging or developer-friendly checks.
- `__session_info__`, that contains information from the server that is always needed and for which
  we don't want to perform an additional request. More on this in the next section.

5. Controller that renders the view
===================================

Now that we have the view, we need to make it accessible to the user. For that purpose, we will create
an :ref:`HTTP controller<reference/controllers>` that renders that view and returns it to the user.

.. code-block:: py

    from odoo.http import request, route, Controller

    class YourController(Controller):
        @route("/your_module/standalone_app", auth="public")
        def standalone_app(self):
            return request.render(
                'your_module.standalone_app',
                {
                    'session_info': request.env['ir.http'].get_frontend_session_info(),
                }
            )

Notice how we're giving the template `session_info`. We get it from the `get_frontend_session_info`
method, and it will end up containing information used by the web framework, such as the current
user's ID if they are logged in, the server version, the Odoo edition, etc.

At this point, if you open the url `/your_module/standalone_app` in your brower, you should
see a blank page with the text "Hello, World!". At this point, you can start actually writing the
code for your app.
