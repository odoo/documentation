Legal framework for electronic signatures in India
==================================================

In India, electronic signatures are regulated under the `Information Technology Act (ITA) <https://eprocure.gov.in/cppp/rulesandprocs/kbadqkdlcswfjdelrquehwuxcfmijmuixngudufgbuubgubfugbububjxcgfvsbdihbgfGhdfgFHytyhRtMjk4NzY=>`_,
the `Indian Contract Act (ICA)
<https://www.indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/2187/2/A187209.pdf>`_ and the Electronic Signature
or Electronic Authentication Technique and Procedure Rules (ESEATPR). The law provides the
foundation for the use and legal recognition of electronic signatures. The key points of the law
include:

- **Legal recognition**: electronic signatures are legally equivalent to handwritten signatures if
  they meet certain criteria.
- **Reliability and security**: electronic signatures must be created with a secure method that can
  reliably identify the signatory and ensure the integrity of the signed document.
- **Digital signature certificates**: the law recognizes digital signature certificates that serve
  as proof of identity of an individual for a certain purpose that can be used in special cases to
  provide additional security.
