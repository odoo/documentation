**Odoo Spreadsheet** allows you to organize, manipulate, analyze, and visualize data. It offers
similar functionality to other spreadsheet solutions with the added benefit of integrating directly
with your Odoo database.

With Odoo Spreadsheet, you can:

- :ref:`create spreadsheets <spreadsheet/create-new>` or :ref:`upload files
  <spreadsheet/upload-files>` and open them with Odoo Spreadsheet
- :doc:`create templates <spreadsheet/templates>`
- :doc:`use functions, including Odoo-specific functions <spreadsheet/functions>`
- :doc:`insert and link to Odoo data <spreadsheet/insert>`
- :doc:`create and use dynamic pivot tables <spreadsheet/dynamic_pivot_tables>`
- filter data across multiple Odoo data sources using :doc:`global filters
  <spreadsheet/global_filters>`
- visualize data using charts and formatting
- share files internally and externally

The Spreadsheet module is part of **Odoo Documents**.

.. tip::
   Within a spreadsheet, opening the command palette, using the :doc:`keyboard shortcut
   <../../applications/essentials/keyboard_shortcuts>` `Ctrl` + `K` or `Command` + `K`, allows you
   to browse and execute spreadsheet commands via the keyboard, without having to navigate menus.

.. note::
   Odoo spreadsheets serve as the foundation for the :doc:`dashboards available in Odoo Dashboards
   <../../applications/productivity/dashboards>`. On a dashboard, charts and data tables are used to
   display dynamic Odoo data and provide an overview of key business metrics.

   :ref:`Standard, pre-configured dashboards
   <dashboards/consult-dashboards/standard>` can be :ref:`customized
   <build_and_customize_dashboards/customize>` by editing the dashboard's underlying spreadsheet via
   Dashboards. :ref:`Custom dashboards
   <build_and_customize_dashboards/build>` can also be created from scratch, starting from an Odoo
   spreadsheet; any subsequent :ref:`modifications <build_and_customize_dashboards/customize>` are
   performed via Dashboards.

.. _spreadsheet/create-new:

Create a new spreadsheet
========================

To create a new spreadsheet:

#. Open Odoo Documents and navigate to the section or folder in which the spreadsheet should be
   created.
#. Click :guilabel:`New` and select :guilabel:`Spreadsheet`.

   .. tip::
      Alternatively, from the :icon:`fa-folder-o` :guilabel:`All` folder, click :guilabel:`New` and
      select :guilabel:`Spreadsheet`, then select in which :guilabel:`Folder` the
      spreadsheet should be created.

#. Click :guilabel:`Blank spreadsheet` or, to create a new spreadsheet using an existing
   :doc:`template <spreadsheet/templates>`, select the relevant template.
#. Click :guilabel:`Create`.
#. Click on `Untitled spreadsheet` at the top of the screen to edit the name of the spreadsheet.

.. tip::
   It is also possible to create a new spreadsheet by:

   - clicking :menuselection:`File -->` :icon:`os-clear-and-reload` :menuselection:`New` from the
     menu bar of an open spreadsheet; or
   - :doc:`inserting a list, pivot table, or chart from another Odoo app <spreadsheet/insert>` into
     a new spreadsheet directly from the app in question.

   In these cases, the new spreadsheet is saved in Odoo Documents in the :icon:`fa-hdd-o`
   :guilabel:`My Drive` personal folder.

.. _spreadsheet/upload-files:

Upload files
============

Files in `.xlsx` or `.csv` format can be uploaded into Odoo Documents and opened with Odoo
Spreadsheet. To do so:

#. Open Odoo Documents and navigate to the section or folder where the spreadsheet should be saved.
#. Click :guilabel:`New` and select :guilabel:`Upload`.
#. Select the relevant `.xlsx` or `.csv` file and click :guilabel:`Open`.
#. Click on the uploaded file.
#. By default, the original file is deleted when it is opened with Odoo Spreadsheet. To preserve
   the original file in the same folder in Odoo Documents, disable :guilabel:`Send source file to
   trash`.
#. Click :guilabel:`Open with Odoo Spreadsheet`.

The file can now be fully edited in Odoo Spreadsheet.

.. _spreadsheet/manage-spreadsheets:

Manage spreadsheets
===================

Users with :guilabel:`Editor` rights to a specific spreadsheet have various options for managing the
spreadsheet via the :guilabel:`File` menu:

- :icon:`os-copy-file` :guilabel:`Make a copy`: creates a duplicate of the current spreadsheet with
  the same :ref:`regional settings <spreadsheet/manage-spreadsheets/regional-settings>` (or locale).
- :icon:`os-save` :guilabel:`Save as template`: allows the current spreadsheet to be used as a
  :doc:`template <spreadsheet/templates>` for future spreadsheets.
- :icon:`os-download` :guilabel:`Download`: downloads the spreadsheet in `.xlsx` format.

  .. important::
     When you download a spreadsheet in `.xlsx` format, any spreadsheet formulas that retrieve Odoo
     data from your database, e.g., via an :doc:`inserted list <spreadsheet/insert>` or via other
     :doc:`Odoo-specific functions <spreadsheet/functions>`, are converted to the values they would
     have returned at the moment the spreadsheet was downloaded.

  .. tip::
     Users with :guilabel:`Viewer` rights can also download a spreadsheet in `.xlsx` format.

- :icon:`os-version-history` :guilabel:`See version history`: provides read-only :ref:`access to
  previous versions <spreadsheet/manage-spreadsheets/version-history>` of the current spreadsheet,
  which can be named and restored if needed.
- :icon:`fa-print` :guilabel:`Print`: prints a copy of the spreadsheet on a connected printer.
- :icon:`os-cog` :guilabel:`Settings`: allows you to view and change the :ref:`locale
  <spreadsheet/manage-spreadsheets/regional-settings>` of the current spreadsheet.
- :icon:`os-add-to-dashboard` :guilabel:`Add to dashboard`: :ref:`converts
  <spreadsheet/manage-spreadsheets/convert-to-dashboard>` the current spreadsheet into an Odoo
  dashboard.

.. _spreadsheet/manage-spreadsheets/version-history:

Version history
---------------

Odoo Spreadsheet automatically saves versions of spreadsheets as changes are made, allowing users
with :guilabel:`Editor` rights to browse and restore previous versions.

To access the version history of a spreadsheet, click :menuselection:`File -->`
:icon:`os-version-history` :menuselection:`See version history` from the menu bar. Saved versions
appear in a panel on the right of the spreadsheet. The name of the user who made the change is
shown, as well as the date and time of the change.

The following actions are possible:

- **View an earlier version** in read-only format by clicking on the relevant version.
- **Restore an earlier version** by clicking :icon:`fa-ellipsis-v` :guilabel:`(vertical ellipsis)`
  then :guilabel:`Restore this version`.
- **Copy an earlier version** by clicking :icon:`fa-ellipsis-v` :guilabel:`(vertical ellipsis)` then
  :menuselection:`Make a copy`. A copy of the version opens as a new spreadsheet.
- **Create named versions** by clicking on the date and time of the relevant version and entering
  the desired name. The date and time of the version are then displayed below the new name.

.. tip::
   When viewing an earlier, read-only version of a spreadsheet, the following actions are still
   possible:

   - Search the spreadsheet by clicking :menuselection:`Edit -->` :icon:`fa-search`
     :menuselection:`Find and replace` or using the shortcut `Ctrl` + `H`.
   - Copy an individual cell or selected area by clicking :menuselection:`Edit -->`
     :icon:`fa-clipboard` :menuselection:`Copy` or using the shortcut `Ctrl` + `C`.

.. _spreadsheet/manage-spreadsheets/regional-settings:

Regional settings
-----------------

To ensure data is displayed consistently for all users, the regional settings (or locale) of a
spreadsheet, are managed at spreadsheet level. This locale affects the following settings and
formats:

- thousand and decimal separators
- date and time formats
- first day of the week

By default, a new spreadsheet inherits the regional settings of the user who created it. For
example, any spreadsheets created by a user whose language is set to :guilabel:`French (BE) /
FranÃ§ais (BE)` will follow Belgian French conventions.

A spreadsheet's locale can be viewed and changed at any time by a user with :guilabel:`Editor`
rights. To view the locale of a spreadsheet, click :menuselection:`File -->` :icon:`os-cog`
:menuselection:`Settings` from the menu bar. The :guilabel:`Spreadsheet settings` panel opens on the
right of the spreadsheet. To change the locale, select the appropriate locale from the dropdown.

.. tip::
   When you open a spreadsheet that has a different locale to that of your user profile, a blue
   :icon:`fa-globe` :guilabel:`(globe)` icon appears at the top right of the spreadsheet. Hovering
   over the icon reveals a warning message that indicates the spreadsheet locale and highlights
   formats that differ.

   .. image:: spreadsheet/locale-difference.png
      :alt: Warning about difference between user and spreadsheet locale

   If no :icon:`fa-globe` :guilabel:`(globe)` icon is shown, this means the spreadsheet's locale is
   the same as that of your user profile.

.. _spreadsheet/manage-spreadsheets/convert-to-dashboard:

Convert a spreadsheet into a dashboard
--------------------------------------

A user with the appropriate :ref:`access rights <access-rights/groups>` can convert an Odoo
spreadsheet into a dashboard that is then accessible via
:doc:`Odoo Dashboards <../../../applications/productivity/dashboards>`. To do so:

#. Click :menuselection:`File -->` :icon:`os-add-to-dashboard` :menuselection:`Add to dashboard`
   from the menu bar.
#. Enter the :guilabel:`Dashboard Name`.
#. Select the relevant :guilabel:`Dashboard Section` from the dropdown or, to create a new dashboard
   section, type the name of the new section, then click :guilabel:`Create`.
#. If necessary, modify the :guilabel:`Access Groups` to determine which :ref:`user groups
   <dashboards/access-and-sharing>` can access the dashboard.
#. Click :guilabel:`Create`.

.. tip::
   - By default, the first tab of the spreadsheet serves as the front end of the dashboard.
   - It is also possible to convert a spreadsheet to a dashboard from within the :ref:`Dashboard
     configuration settings <dashboards/configuration>`, by directly adding the spreadsheet to
     an existing or new dashboard section.
   - After a spreadsheet has been converted to a dashboard, it is deleted from Odoo Documents. Any
     subsequent :ref:`modifications <build_and_customize_dashboards/customize>` need to be made via
     Odoo Dashboards.
