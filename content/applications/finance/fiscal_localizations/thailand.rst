Tax report
==========

Odoo allows users to generate Excel files to submit their VAT to the **Revenue Department** of
Thailand.

Sales and purchase tax report
-----------------------------

To generate a sales and purchase tax report, go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Reporting --> Tax
Report`. Select a specific time or time range on the tax report, and click
:guilabel:`VAT-202-01 (xlsx)` for purchase tax and :guilabel:`VAT-202-02 (xlsx)` for sales tax.

Withholding PND tax report
--------------------------

PND report data displays the summarized amounts of the applicable **withholding corporate income
tax returns (domestic)** from vendor bills under the :guilabel:`PND53 (TH)` and
:guilabel:`PND3 (TH)` tax reports. It is installed by default with the Thai localization.

.. image:: thailand/pnd-report.png
   :alt: PND tax reports

.. note::
   Withholding corporate income tax returns (domestic) is the tax used in case the company has
   withheld the tax from ‚Äú**Personal (PND3)**‚Äù or ‚Äú**Corporate (PND53)**‚Äù services provided such as
   rental, hiring, transportation, insurance, management fee, consulting, etc.

The PND tax report allows users to generate a CSV file for bills to upload on the
`RDprep for Thailand e-Filling application <https://efiling.rd.go.th/rd-cms/>`_.

To generate a PND CSV file, go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Reporting --> Tax Report`, select a
specific time or time range on the tax report, and click :guilabel:`PND3` or :guilabel:`PND53`.

This generates the :file:`Tax Report PND3.csv` and :file:`Tax Report PND53.csv` files that lists all
the vendor bill lines with the applicable withholding tax.

.. warning::
   Odoo cannot generate the PND or PDF report or **withholding tax certificate** directly. The
   generated :file:`Tax Report PND3.csv` and :file:`Tax Report PND53.csv` files must be exported
   to an external tool to convert them into a **withholding PND** report or a **PDF** file.

Tax invoice
===========

The **tax invoice PDF** report can be generated from Odoo through the **Invoicing** module. Users
have the  option to print PDF reports for normal invoices and tax invoices. To print out
**tax invoices**, users can click on :guilabel:`Print Invoices` in Odoo. Regular invoices can be
printed as **commercial invoices** by clicking on :menuselection:`Cog button (‚öôÔ∏è) --> Print -->
Commercial Invoice`.

Headquarter/Branch number settings
----------------------------------

You can inform a company's **Headquarters** and **Branch number** in the **Contacts** app. Once
in the app, open the **contact form** of the company and under the :guilabel:`Sales & Purchase` tab:

- If the contact is identified as a branch, input the **Branch number** in the
  :guilabel:`Company ID` field.
- If the contact is a **Headquarters**, leave the :guilabel:`Company ID` field **blank**.

.. tip::
   This information is used in the **tax invoice** PDF report and PND **tax report** export.

PromptPay QR code on invoices
=============================

The **PromptPay QR code** is a QR code that can be added to invoices to allow customers to pay their
bills using the PromptPay-supported bank mobile application. The QR code is generated based on the
**invoice amount** and one of the following **merchant information**:

- Ewallet ID
- Merchant Tax ID
- Mobile Number

Activate QR codes
-----------------

Go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`. Under the :guilabel:`Customer
Payments` section, activate the :guilabel:`QR Codes` feature.

PromptPay QR bank account configuration
---------------------------------------

Go to :menuselection:`Contacts --> Configuration --> Bank Accounts` and select the bank account for
which you want to activate PromptPay QR. Set the :guilabel:`Proxy Type` and fill in the
:guilabel:`Proxy Value` field depending on the chosen type.

.. important::
   - The account holder's city is mandatory.
   - The :guilabel:`Include Reference` checkbox doesn't work for PromptPay QR codes.

Issue invoices with PromptPay QR code
-------------------------------------

When creating a new invoice, open the :guilabel:`Other Info` tab and set the :guilabel:`Payment
QR-code` option to :guilabel:`EMV Merchant-Presented QR-code`.

Ensure that the :guilabel:`Recipient Bank` is the one you configured, as Odoo uses this field to
generate the PromptPay QR code.
