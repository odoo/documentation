Introduction
============

In Odoo, lots and serial numbers have similarities in their functional
system but are different in their behavior. They are both managed within
the **Inventory**, **Purchases** and **Sales** app.

**Lots** correspond to a certain number of products you received and store
altogether in one single pack.

**Serial numbers** are identification numbers given to one product in
particular, to allow to track the history of the item from reception to
delivery and after-sales.

When to use
-----------

**Lots** are interesting for products you receive in great quantity and for
which a lot number can help in reportings, quality controls, or any
other info. Lots will help identify a number of pieces having for
instance a production fault. It can be useful for a batch production of
clothes or food.

**Serial numbers** are interesting for items that could require after-sales
service, such as smartphones, laptops, fridges, and any electronic
devices. You could use the manufacturer's serial number or your own,
depending on the way you manage these products

When not to use
---------------

Storing consumable products such as kitchen roll, toilet paper, pens and
paper blocks in lots would make no sense at all, as there are very few
chances that you can return them for production fault.

On the other hand, giving a serial number to every product is a
time-consuming task that will have a purpose only in the case of items
that have a warranty and/or after-sales services. Putting a serial
number on bread, for instance, makes no sense at all.
