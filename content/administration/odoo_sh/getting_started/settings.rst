Settings
==================================

Overview
========

The settings allow you to manage the configuration of your project.

Project name
============

The name of your project.

.. image:: ./media/interface-settings-projectname.png
   :align: center

This defines the address that will be used to access your production database.

Addresses of your staging and development builds are derived from this name and assigned automatically.
However, when you change your project name, only future builds will use the new name.

Collaborators
=============

Manage the Github users who can access your project.

.. image:: ./media/interface-settings-collaborators.png
   :align: center

There are two levels of users:

* Admin: has access to all features of Odoo.sh.
* User: does not have access to the project settings nor to the production and staging databases.

The user group is meant for developers who can make modifications in your code but are not allowed to access the
production data.
Users of this group cannot connect to the production and staging databases using the *1-click connect* feature,
but they can of course use their regular account on these databases if they have one, using their regular credentials.

In addition, they cannot use the webshell nor have access to the server logs.

Public Access
=============

Allow public access to your development builds.

.. image:: ./media/interface-settings-public.png
   :align: center

If activated, this option exposes the Builds page publicly, allowing visitors to connect to your development builds.

In addition, visitors have access to the logs, shell and mails of your development builds.

Production and staging builds are excluded, visitors can only see their status.

Custom domains
==============

To configure additional domains please refer to the corresponding branch's :ref:`settings tab <odoosh-gettingstarted-branches-tabs-settings>`.

.. _odoosh-gettingstarted-settings-submodules:

Submodules
==========

Configure the deploy keys for the private repositories you use
as submodules in your branches to allow Odoo.sh to download them.

.. Warning::
  These settings are required for **private repositories** only.
  If you are looking on how to set up your submodules,
  instructions are available in the chapter :ref:`Submodules <odoosh-advanced-submodules>` of this documentation.

.. image:: ./media/interface-settings-submodules.png
   :align: center

When a repository is private, it is not possible to publicly download its branches and revisions.
For that reason, you need to configure a deploy key for Odoo.sh,
so the remote Git server allows our platform to download the revisions
of this private repository.

To configure the deploy key for a private repository, proceed as follows:

* in the input, paste the SSH URL of your private sub-repository and click on *Add*,

  * e.g. *git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git*
  * it can be another Git server than Github, such as Bitbucket, Gitlab or even your own self-hosted server

* copy the public key,

  * it should look like *ssh-rsa some...random...characters...here...==*

* in the settings of the private sub-repository, add the public key amongst the deploy keys.

  * Github.com: :menuselection:`Settings --> Deploy keys --> Add deploy key`
  * Bitbucket.com: :menuselection:`Settings --> Access keys --> Add key`
  * Gitlab.com: :menuselection:`Settings --> Repository --> Deploy Keys`
  * Self-hosted: append the key to the git userâ€™s authorized_keys file in its .ssh directory

Storage Size
============

This section shows the storage size used by your project.

.. image:: ./media/interface-settings-storage.png
   :align: center

Storage size is computed as follows:

* the size of the PostgreSQL database

* the size of the disk files available in your container: database filestore, sessions storage directory...

.. Warning::
  In case you want to analyze disk usage, you can run the tool `ncdu <https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu/man>`_ in your Web Shell.

Should your production database size grow to exceed what's provisioned in your subscription, it
will automatically be synchronized with it.

Database Workers
================

Additional database workers can be configured here. More workers help increase the load your
production database is able to handle. If you add more, it will automatically be synchronized
with your subscription.

.. image:: ./media/interface-settings-workers.png
   :align: center

.. Warning::
  Adding more workers will not magically solve all performance issues. It only allows the server
  to handle more connections at the same time. If some operations are unusually slow, it's most
  likely a problem with the code, if it's not due to your own customizations you can open a ticket
  `here <https://www.odoo.com/help>`_.

Staging Branches
================

Additional staging branches allow you to develop and test more features at the same time. If you
add more, it will automatically be synchronized with your subscription.

   :align: center

Activation
==========

Shows the status of the project's activation. You can change the project's activation code if needed.
