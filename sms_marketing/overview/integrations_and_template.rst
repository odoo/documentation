Integrations and Templates
==========================

Using SMS to reach people can be a strategy not just used for advertisement purposes, but also as a
reminder of events or issued invoices to your costumers, for example.

Campaigns
=========

First, make sure to have the necessary feature activated. Go to the :menuselection:`Email Marketing
app --> Configuration --> Settings` and enable *Mailing Campaigns*.

Now, the menu *Campaigns* is also available on the *SMS Marketing* app, allowing you to manage and
have an overview of your SMS mailings under campaigns.

This feature is especially useful if you have aggregated campaigns, as you have a global reporting
view. In addition to that, you can create stages in your Kanban view to better organize the work
being done.

Sending SMSs through the Contacts app
=====================================

| Sending SMSs through the contactâ€™s form is available by default in Odoo. It makes your work easier
  if you need to send an SMS to a specific contact, for example.
| For that, go to the *Contacts* app, select the contact and click on the *SMS* icon next to the
  phone number.

all the contacts needed, and under *Action* select *Send SMS*.
