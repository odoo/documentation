Raise warnings on purchase orders
=================================

The *Warnings* feature allows you to raise warnings or blocking
messages on purchase orders based on a vendor or a product.

For example, if you often have a problem with a vendor, you might want
to raise a warning when purchasing from that vendor. If a product is
about to be discontinued, you may want to raise a blocking message on
the purchase order.

Configuration
=============

For this feature to work, go to
:menuselection:`Purchases --> Configuration --> Settings` and activate
the *Warnings* feature.

clicking ok.
