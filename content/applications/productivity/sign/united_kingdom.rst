Legal framework for electronic signatures in the United Kingdom
===============================================================

In the United Kingdom, electronic signatures are regulated under Electronic Communications Act
(ECA), and the `UK version <https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-eidas/>`_ of Regulation
(EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic
identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (eIDAS) as
amended by the `Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions
<https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/89/made>`_ (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI
2019/89) (the “UK eIDAS Regulation”). The law provides the foundation for the use and legal
recognition of electronic signatures. The key points of the law include:

- **Legal recognition**: electronic signatures are legally equivalent to handwritten signatures if
  they meet certain criteria.
- **Reliability and security**: electronic signatures must be created with a secure method that can
  reliably identify the signatory and ensure the integrity of the signed document.
- **Digital signature certificates**: the law recognizes digital signature certificates that serve
  as proof of identity of an individual for a certain purpose that can be used in special cases to
  provide additional security. These certificates are issued by Certification Authorities and are
  required by law for the signature of specific acts.
