Bank and cash accounts
======================

You can manage as many bank or cash accounts as needed on your database. Configuring them correctly
allows you to have all your banking data up-to-date and ready for :doc:`reconciliation
<bank/reconciliation>` with your journal entries.

In Odoo Accounting, each bank account has a dedicated journal set to post all entries in a dedicated
account. Both the journal and the account are automatically created and configured whenever you add
a bank account.

.. note::
   Cash journals and accounts must be configured manually.

Bank journals are displayed by default on the :guilabel:`Accounting Dashboard` in the form of cards
which include action buttons.

To connect your bank account to your database, go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration
--> Add a Bank Account`, select your bank in the list, click on :guilabel:`Connect`, and follow the
instructions.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`bank/bank_synchronization`

.. _accounting/bank/create:

Create a bank account
---------------------

If your banking institution is not available in Odoo, or if you don't want to connect your bank
account to your database, you can configure your bank account manually.

To manually add a bank account, go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Add a Bank
Account`, click on :guilabel:`Record transactions manually` (at the bottom right), fill out the bank
information, and click :guilabel:`Create`.

.. note::
   - Odoo automatically detects the bank account type (e.g., IBAN) and enables some features
     accordingly.
   - A default bank journal is available and can be used to configure your bank account by going to
     :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Accounting: Journals --> Bank`. Open it and
     edit the different fields to match your bank account information.

Create a cash journal
---------------------

To create a new cash journal, go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Accounting:
Journals`, click on :guilabel:`Create` and select :guilabel:`Cash` in the :guilabel:`Type` field.

For more information on the accounting information fields, read the
:ref:`accounting/bank/configuration` section of this page.

.. note::
   A default cash journal is available and can be used straight away. You can review it by going to
   :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Accounting: Journals --> Cash`.

.. _accounting/bank/suspense:

Suspense account
----------------

Bank statement transactions are posted on the suspense account until they are reconciled. At any
moment, the suspense account's balance in the general ledger shows the balance of transactions that
have not yet been reconciled.

.. note::
   When a bank transaction is reconciled, the journal entry is modified to replace the bank suspense
   account with the account of the journal item it is reconciled with. This account is usually the
   :ref:`outstanding receipts or payments account <accounting/bank/outstanding-accounts>` if
   reconciling with a registered payment or the account receivable or payable if reconciling with
   an invoice or bill directly.

Profit and loss accounts
------------------------

The :guilabel:`Profit Account` is used to register a profit when the ending balance of a cash
register differs from what the system computes, while the :guilabel:`Loss Account` is used to
register a loss when the ending balance of a cash register differs from what the system computes.

Currency
--------

You can edit the currency used to enter the transactions.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`get_started/multi_currency`

Account number
--------------

If you need to **edit your bank account details**, click on the external link arrow next to your
:guilabel:`Account Number`. On the account page, click on the external link arrow next to your
:guilabel:`Bank` and update your bank information accordingly. These details are used when
registering payments.

Bank feeds
----------

:guilabel:`Bank Feeds` defines how the bank transactions are registered. Three options are
available:

- :guilabel:`Undefined yet`, which should be selected when you donâ€™t know yet if you will
  synchronize your bank account with your database or not.
- :guilabel:`Import (CAMT, CODA, CSV, OFX, QIF)`, which should be selected if you want to import
  your bank statements and transactions using a different format.
- :guilabel:`Automated Bank Synchronization`, which should be selected if your bank is synchronized
  with your database.

.. seealso::
   - :doc:`bank/bank_synchronization`
   - :doc:`bank/transactions`

.. _accounting/bank/outstanding-accounts:

Outstanding accounts
====================

By default, payments in Odoo do not create journal entries, but they can easily be configured to
create journal entries using **outstanding accounts**.

- An **outstanding receipts account** is where incoming payments are posted until they are linked
  with incoming bank transactions.
- An **outstanding payments account** is where outgoing payments are posted until they are linked
  with outgoing bank transactions.

These accounts are usually of :ref:`type <chart-of-account/type>` :guilabel:`Current Assets` and
:guilabel:`Current Liabilities`.

Payments that are registered in Odoo are posted to the outstanding receipts and outstanding accounts
until they are reconciled. At any moment, the outstanding receipts account's balance in the general
ledger shows the balance of registered incoming payments that have not yet been reconciled, and the
outstanding payments account's balance in the general ledger shows the balance of registered
outgoing payments that have not yet been reconciled.

Bank and cash journal configuration
-----------------------------------

To configure payments to create journal entries, set outstanding accounts for the journal's payment
methods. This can be done for any journal with the :ref:`type <chart-of-account/type>`
:guilabel:`Bank` or :guilabel:`Cash`.

To configure the outstanding accounts for a journal's payment methods, first go to
:menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals` and select a bank or cash journal. In the
:guilabel:`Incoming Payments` and :guilabel:`Outgoing Payments` tabs, set :guilabel:`Outstanding
Receipts accounts` and :guilabel:`Outstanding Payments accounts` for each payment method that you
want to create journal entries.

.. note::
   - If the main bank account of the journal is added as an outstanding receipts account or
     outstanding payments account, when a payment is registered, the invoice or bill's status is
     directly set to :guilabel:`Paid`.
   - If the outstanding receipts or outstanding payments account for a payment method is left blank,
     registering a payment with that payment method will not create any journal entry.
