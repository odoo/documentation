.. warning::
    In order for an exchange difference entry to be created automatically, the
    corresponding invoices and payments need to be fully reconciled. This means
    the invoices are fully paid and the payments are fully spent on invoices.
    If you partially pay 3 invoices from 2 payments, and the last invoice still
    has an amount due, there will be no exchange difference entry for any of
    them until that final amount is paid.
