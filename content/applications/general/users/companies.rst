Companies
=========

A centralized management environment allows you to select multiple companies simultaneously and set
their specific warehouses, customers, equipment, and contacts. It provides you the ability to
generate reports of aggregated figures without switching interfaces, which facilitates daily tasks
and the overall management process.

Manage companies and records
============================

Go to :menuselection:`Settings --> Manage Companies` and fill in the form with your company’s
information. If a *Parent Company* is selected, records are shared between the two companies (as
long as both environments are active).

.. tip::
   Activate the :ref:`developer mode <developer-mode>` to choose a *Favicon* for each of your
   companies, and easily identify them by the browser tabs. Set your favicons’ files size to 16x16
   or 32x32 pixels. JPG, PNG, GIF, and ICO are extensions accepted.

Switch between or select multiple companies by enabling their selection boxes to activate them. The
grayed company is the one which environment is in use. To switch environments, click on the
company’s name. In the example below, the user has access to three companies, two are activated, and
the environment in use is of *JS Store US*.

Data such as Products, Contacts, and Equipment can be shared or set to be shown for a specific
company only. To do so, on their forms, choose between:

- *A blank field*: the record is shared within all companies.
- *Adding a company*: the record is visible to users logged in to that specific company.

Employees' access
=================

Once companies are created, manage your employees' :doc:`Access Rights <access_rights>`
for *Multi Companies*.

| If a user has multiple companies *activated* on his database, and he is **editing** a record,
  the editing happens on the record's related company.
| Example: if editing a sale order issued under JS Store US while working on the JS Store Belgium
  environment, the changes are applied under JS Store US (the company from which the sale order
  was issued).
| When **creating** a record, the company taken into account is:

- The current company (the one active) or,
- No company is set (on products and contacts’ forms for example) or,
- The company set is the one linked to the document (the same as if a record is being edited).

Documents’ format
=================

To set documents' formats according to each company, *activate* and *select* the respective one and,
under *Settings*, click on *Configure Document Layout*.

Inter-Company Transactions
==========================

First, make sure each one of your companies is properly set in relation to:

- :doc:`Chart of Accounts
  <../../finance/accounting/getting_started/initial_configuration/chart_of_accounts>`
- :doc:`Taxes <../../finance/accounting/taxation/taxes/default_taxes>`
- :doc:`Fiscal Positions <../../finance/accounting/taxation/taxes/fiscal_positions>`
- :doc:`Journals <../../finance/accounting/bank/setup/bank_accounts>`
- :doc:`Fiscal Localizations
  <../../finance/accounting/fiscal_localizations/overview/fiscal_localization_packages>`
- :doc:`Pricelists <../../sales/sales/products_prices/prices/pricing>`
- :doc:`Warehouses <../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/management/warehouses/warehouse_creation>`

Now, activate the *Inter-Company Transactions* option under *Settings*. With the respective company
*activated* and *selected*, choose if you would like operations between companies to be synchronized
at an invoice/bills level or at a sales/purchase orders level.

- **Synchronize invoice/bills**: generates a bill/invoice when a company confirms a bill/invoice for
  the selected company.

  *Example:* an invoice posted on JS Store Belgium, for JS Store US, automatically creates a vendor
  bill on the JS Store US, from the JS Store Belgium.

- **Synchronize sales/purchase order**: generates a drafted purchase/sales order using the selected
  company warehouse when a sales/purchase order is confirmed for the selected company. If instead of
  a drafted purchase/sales order you rather have it validated, enable *Automatic Validation*.

  *Example:* when a sale order for JS Store US is confirmed on JS Store Belgium, a purchase order
  on JS Store Belgium is automatically created (and confirmed if the *Automatic Validation* feature
  was enabled).

.. note::
   Products have to be configured as *Can be sold* and must be shared between the companies.

.. tip::
   Remember to test all workflows as an user other than the administrator.
