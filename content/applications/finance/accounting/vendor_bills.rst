Vendor bills
============

Vendor bills can be registered either **manually** or **automatically** in Odoo. The
:ref:`Aged Payable report <accounting/vendor_bills/age-payable-report>` provides an overview of all
outstanding bills to help ensure timely payment of the correct amounts.

Bill creation
=============

.. _accounting/vendor_bills/creation-manual:

Manually
--------

To create a vendor bill manually, go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Vendors --> Bills` and
click :guilabel:`New`.

.. tip::
   Alternatively, it is possible to create a vendor bill from the Accounting dashboard:

   - either click :guilabel:`New` on the :guilabel:`Vendor Bills` journal;
   - or click the :icon:`fa-ellipsis-v` :guilabel:`(vertical ellipsis)` icon of the
     :guilabel:`Vendor Bills` journal, then :guilabel:`Bill` under the :guilabel:`New` section.

.. _accounting/vendor_bills/automatic:

Automatically
-------------

Vendor bills can be automatically created through various methods:

- Emailing to an :ref:`email alias <invoice-digitization/email-alias>` associated with the purchase
  journal. If the email does not contain a valid file, an automatic response notifies the sender
  that no document was received.
- Uploading a PDF: To upload a bill, go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Vendors --> Bills`, then
  click :guilabel:`Upload`.

.. note::
   - Once the bill is uploaded, the PDF document appears on the right side of the screen, making it
     easy to fill in the bill information.
   - Bills can be :doc:`digitized <vendor_bills/invoice_digitization>` for automatic completion.
   - Services such as digitizing scanned or PDF vendor bills in Odoo require :doc:`In-App
     Purchase (IAP) </applications/essentials/in_app_purchase>` credits.

To automatically post bills from selected vendors, go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Vendors -->
Vendors` and select the relevant vendor. In the :guilabel:`Accounting` tab, under the
:guilabel:`Automation` section, update the :guilabel:`Auto-post bills` field  with one of the
following options:

- :guilabel:`Always`
- :guilabel:`Ask after 3 validations without edits`
- :guilabel:`Never`

.. _accounting/vendor_bills/bill-completion:

Bill completion
===============

Whether the bill is created manually or automatically, make sure the following fields are
appropriately completed:

- :guilabel:`Vendor`: Odoo automatically fills in some information based on the information on the
  vendor's contact record as well as previous purchase orders and bills.
- :guilabel:`Bill Reference`: Add the sales order reference provided by the vendor. This field is
  used to :ref:`match <accounting/payments/payments-matching>` the products when they are received.
- :guilabel:`Auto-Complete`: Select a past bill/purchase order to complete the document
  automatically. The :guilabel:`Vendor` field should be completed before completing this field.
- :guilabel:`Bill Date`: Select the document's issuance date.
- :guilabel:`Accounting Date`: Update the document's accounting registration date if needed.
- :guilabel:`Payment Reference`: The :guilabel:`Memo` field automatically includes the payment
  reference once the payment is registered.
- :guilabel:`Recipient Bank`: Indicates the account number to which the payment will be made. This
  field is required when paying via batch payment files (such as :ref:`NACHA
  <l10n_us/ach-electronic-transfers>` and :doc:`SEPA <payments/pay_sepa>`).
- :guilabel:`Due Date` or :guilabel:`Payment Terms` must be specified for the bill payment.
- :guilabel:`Journal`: Select which journal should record the bill and in which :doc:`currency
  <get_started/multi_currency>`.

In the :guilabel:`Invoice Lines` tab:

- :guilabel:`Product`: Click :guilabel:`Add a line`, then search for and select the product.
- :guilabel:`Quantity`
- :guilabel:`Price`
- :doc:`Taxes <taxes>` (if applicable)

.. tip::
   If the bill line does not correspond to an existing product in the database, click the
   :icon:`oi-view-list` :guilabel:`(bars)` icon to enter a description for the bill line without
   linking it to a product.

To access the product catalog and view all items in an organized display, click :doc:`Catalog
</applications/inventory_and_mrp/inventory/warehouses_storage/inventory_management/product_catalog>`.
When the products and quantities are selected, click :guilabel:`Back to Bill` to return to the
vendor bill; the selected catalog items will appear in the vendor bill lines.

.. note::
   Multiple bills for the same purchase order may be issued if the vendor is on back-order and sends
   invoices as products are shipped or if the vendor sends partial bills or requests a deposit. In
   this case, multiple bills may have the same :guilabel:`Bill Reference`.

.. _accounting/vendor_bills/bill-confirmation:

Bill confirmation
=================

Click :guilabel:`Confirm` when the document is completed. The status changes to :guilabel:`Posted`,
and a journal entry is generated based on the vendor bill information. On confirmation, Odoo assigns
each vendor bill a unique number from a defined :doc:`sequence <vendor_bills/sequence>`.

.. note::
   Once confirmed, a vendor bill can no longer be updated. Click :guilabel:`Reset to draft` if
   changes are required.

.. _accounting/vendor_bills/bill-payment:

Payment and reconciliation
==========================

To register a payment, click on :guilabel:`Pay`. In the :guilabel:`Pay` window, select the
:guilabel:`Journal`, the :guilabel:`Payment Method`, the :guilabel:`Amount`, and the
:guilabel:`Currency`.

When the :guilabel:`Amount` paid is less than the total remaining amount on the vendor bill, the
payment is :ref:`partial <accounting/payments/partial-payment>`, and the :guilabel:`Payment
Difference` field displays the outstanding balance.

The :guilabel:`Memo` field is filled automatically if the :guilabel:`Payment Reference` has been set
correctly on the vendor bill. If the field is empty, select the vendor invoice number as a
reference.

Then click :guilabel:`Create payment`. An :guilabel:`In Payment`/:guilabel:`Partial` banner appears
on the bill until it is :doc:`reconciled <bank/reconciliation>` and its status updates to
:guilabel:`Paid`.

.. seealso::
   - :doc:`payments`
   - :doc:`bank/reconciliation`

.. _accounting/vendor_bills/age-payable-report:

Aged payable report
===================

To get an overview of the open vendor bills and their due dates, go to :menuselection:`Accounting
--> Reporting --> Aged payable`.

Click the :icon:`fa-caret-right` :guilabel:`(right arrow)` icon next to a vendor to view the details
of all their outstanding bills, including the due dates and amounts.

.. Note::
   Click :guilabel:`PDF` or :guilabel:`XLSX` to generate a PDF or XLSX file, respectively.
