==================
Users and Features
==================

As the administrator of your database, you are responsible for its usage.
This includes the Apps you install as well as the number of users currently
in use.

Odoo is many things (ERP, CMS, CRM application, e-Commerce backend, etc.)
but it is *not* a smartphone. You should apply caution when adding/removing
features (especially Apps) on your database since this may impact your
subscription amount significantly (or switch you from a free account
to a paying one on our online platform).

This page contains some information as to how you can manage your Odoo 
instances. Before carrying any of these procedures, we **strongly** advise
to test them on a duplicate of your database first. That way, if something goes
wrong, your day-to-day business is not impacted. 

.. note:: You can find guides on how to duplicate your databases both for
    :ref:`online <duplicate_online>` and :ref:`on premise <duplicate_premise>`
    installations.

.. note:: If you have questions about the content of this page or if you
    encounter an issue while carrying out these procedures, please contact
    us through our `support form <https://www.odoo.com/help>`__.


Deactivating Users
==================

.. note:: Make sure you have sufficient **administrative rights** if
    you want to change the status of any of your users. 

In your Odoo instance, click on **Settings**. You will have a section
showing you the active users on your database. Click on **Manage
access rights.** 

+----------------+----------------+
|   |settings|   | |browse_users| |
+----------------+----------------+

You'll then see the list of your users.

    :align: center

.. note:: The pre-selected filter *Internal Users* shows your paying
    users (different from the *Portal Users* which are free). If you
    remove this filter, you'll get all your users (the ones you pay for
    and the portal ones)

In your list of users, click on the user you want to deactivate. As soon
as you are on the userform, go with your mouse cursor on the status
**Active** (top right). Click on Active and you will notice that the
status will change to **Inactive** immediately.

The user is now deactivated. 

.. danger:: **Never** deactivate the main user (*admin*)

Uninstalling Apps
=================

.. warning:: Make sure you first test what you are about to do on a 
    :ref:`duplicate <duplicate>` of your database before making any
    changes (*especially* installing/uninstalling apps).

In your Odoo instance click on **Settings**; in this app, you will be
able to see how many applications you have installed. Click on **Browse
Apps** to access the list of your installed applications. 

+----------------+----------------+
|   |settings|   | |browse_apps|  |
+----------------+----------------+

In your applications' dashboard, you will see all the icons of your
applications. Click on the application you want to uninstall. Then, on
the form of the application, click on **Uninstall**.

    :align: center

.. danger:: Some applications have dependencies, like Invoicing, eCommerce,
    etc. Therefore, the system will give you a warning message to advise
    you of what is about to be removed. If you uninstall your application,
    all its dependencies will be uninstalled as well (and the data in them
    will permanently disappear). If you are sure you still want to uninstall
    it, then click **Confirm**. 

Last, after having checked the warning message (if any), click **Confirm**.

You have finished uninstalling your application. 

Good to know
============

* **Uninstalling apps, managing users, etc. is up to you**: no one else can
  know if your business flow is broken better than you. If we were to uninstall
  applications for you, we would never be able to tell if relevant data had
  been removed or if one of your business flow was broken because we *do not
  know how you work* and therefore cannot validate these kinds of operations.
        
* **Odoo Apps have dependencies**: this means that you may need to install
  modules that you do not actively use to access some features of Odoo
  you might need. For example, the Website Builder app is needed to be
  able to show your customer their Quotes in a web page. Even though you
  might not need or use the Website itself, it is needed for the Online
  Quotes feature to work properly.         
        
* **Always test app installation/removal on a duplicate** (or on a
  free trial database): that way you can know what other apps may
  be required, etc. This will avoid surprises when uninstalling
  or when receiving your invoices.
