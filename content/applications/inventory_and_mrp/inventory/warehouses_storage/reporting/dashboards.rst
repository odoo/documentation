of stock movements. It helps identify areas for process improvement by showing metrics like the
average time transfers are overdue, the average time between creation and validation of transfers,
and the percentage of on-time transfers. It also provides insights into delivery accuracy by
showing the percentage of products actually delivered versus ordered.

The :guilabel:`Warehouse Metrics` dashboard provides a high-level view of the value and availability
of stock. It enables monitoring of stock reservation levels both in quantity and value,
identification of products with negative stock, and analysis of stock distribution and value across
the most used locations and top products. It also tracks important details like the creation date of
stock, so warehouse or purchasing managers can identify slow-moving or stagnant products and take
action, such as promoting, discounting, or returning products.

.. image:: dashboards/warehouse-metrics.png
