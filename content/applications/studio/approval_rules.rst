Approval rules
==============

Studio approval rules are used to automate approval processes for actions. They allow you to define
the criteria for when an approval is required before an action can be performed using a button.

Configuration
=============

To add approval rules, proceed as follows:

#. :ref:`Open Studio <studio/access>` and switch to the required :doc:`view <views>`.
#. Select the button for which you want to add approval rules.
#. In the :guilabel:`Properties` tab on the left, enable the :guilabel:`Set approval rules`
   feature.
#. Specify the :guilabel:`Approval Group` to limit the approval permission to a specific user
   group.
#. Define the :guilabel:`Responsible` user to create an activity for a specific user when an
   approval is requested from them.
#. Add a :guilabel:`Description` to be displayed in the :ref:`Approval dialog <approval-rules/use>`.
#. Enable :guilabel:`Limit approver to this rule` to require approvers to be different users (when
   there are multiple approval rules).

Optionally, you can also add conditions for the approval rule to be applied by clicking the
:icon:`fa-filter` (:guilabel:`filter`) icon next to the :guilabel:`Approval Group` field.

Click :guilabel:`Add an approval rule` to add another rule.

Click the :icon:`fa-trash` (:guilabel:`trash`) icon next to the :guilabel:`Approval group` field to
delete the approval rule.

.. tip::
   You can create :ref:`user groups <access-rights/groups>` specifically for approvals.

Once approval rules have been defined for a button:

- A **user avatar** icon is displayed next to the button's label for each approval rule that has
  been defined.

- When an unauthorized user clicks the button, an error message is displayed in the top-right corner
  and an activity is created for the user specified in the :guilabel:`Responsible` field.
- Only users from the group defined in the :guilabel:`Approval Group` field are allowed to approve
  or reject the action.

Authorized users can:

- approve and perform the action by clicking the button;
- approve the action and allow another user to perform it by clicking the **user avatar** icon next
  to the button's label, then clicking the :icon:`fa-check` (:guilabel:`Approve`) button in the
  dialog that opens.
- reject the action by clicking the **user avatar** icon next to the button's label, then clicking
  the :icon:`fa-times` (:guilabel:`Reject`) button in the dialog that opens.

.. tip::
   - The user who approved/rejected the action can revoke their decision by clicking the **user
     avatar** icon next to the button's label, then clicking the :icon:`fa-undo`
     (:guilabel:`Revoke`) button.
   - Approvals are tracked in the record's chatter. An approval entry is also created every time
     a Studio approval-related action is performed. To access the approval entries, :doc:`activate
     the developer mode </applications/general/developer_mode>` and go to :menuselection:`Settings
     --> Technical --> Studio Approval Entries`.
