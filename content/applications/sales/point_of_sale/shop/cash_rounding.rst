Cash Rounding
=============

**Cash rounding** is required when the lowest physical denomination 
of currency, or the smallest coin, is higher than the minimum unit 
of account.

For example, some countries require their companies to round up or 
down the total amount of an invoice to the nearest five cents, when 
the payment is made in cash.

Each point of sale in Odoo can be configured to apply cash rounding
to the totals of its bills or receipts.

Configuration
=============

Go to :menuselection:`Point of Sale --> Configuration --> Settings` 
and enable *Cash Rounding*, then click on *Save*.

Sale`, open the point of sale you want to configure, and enable the
*Cash Rounding* option.

To define the **Rounding Method**, open the drop-down list and click
on *Create and Edit...*.

Define here your *Rounding Precision*, *Profit Account*, and 
*Loss Account*, then save both the Rounding Method and your Point
of Sale settings.
