Emails allow you to effectively, and at a low cost, reach a large number of consumers while being
able to customize your message in a way that resonates with them. It is measurable, and a
call-to-action oriented channel.

Choose the right target and create the message
==============================================

| Go to :menuselection:`Mailings --> Create`.
| Choosing *Contacts* as *Recipients* (for example), allows you to add specifications to match
  just certain contacts, filtering your target.

   be sent automatically the next day. You need to force that by opening the email and
   clicking on *Retry*.
