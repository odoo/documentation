================================================================
Electronic invoicing (:abbr:`EDI (electronic data interchange)`)
================================================================

EDI, or electronic data interchange, is the inter-company communication of business documents, such
as purchase orders and invoices, in a standard format. Sending documents according to an EDI
standard ensures that the system receiving the message can interpret the information correctly.
Various EDI file formats are available depending on your company's country.

The EDI feature allows companies to automate administrative processes. It may also be required by
some governments for fiscal control or to support administrative procedures.

Electronic sending of documents such as customer invoices, credit notes, or vendor bills is one
application of EDI.

Odoo supports, among others, the following formats.

.. _accounting/e-invoicing/configuration:

Configuration
=============

.. _accounting/e-invoicing/national-electronic-invoicing:

National e-invoicing format
---------------------------

Depending on your company's country (e.g., :doc:`Italy <../../fiscal_localizations/italy>`,
:doc:`Spain <../../fiscal_localizations/spain>`, :doc:`Mexico <../../fiscal_localizations/mexico>`,
etc.), it may be required to issue e-invoicing documents in a specific format for all invoices. In
this case, define a default e-invoicing format for the sales journal.

To do so, go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals`, open the sales journal,
go to the :guilabel:`Advanced Settings` tab, and enable the formats needed for this journal.

.. _accounting/e-invoicing/e-invoicing format:

Customer-specific e-invoicing format
------------------------------------

By default, the format available in the :ref:`send window <accounting/e-invoicing/generation>`
depends on the customer's country.

To define a specific e-invoicing format for a customer, go to :menuselection:`Accounting -->
Customers --> Customers`, open the customer form, go to the :guilabel:`Accounting` tab, and select
the appropriate :guilabel:`Format` in the :guilabel:`Electronic invoicing` section.

.. _accounting/e-invoicing/generation:

E-invoice generation
====================

From a confirmed invoice, click :guilabel:`Send & Print`. In the :guilabel:`Send` window, enable the
relevant e-invoicing format option (e.g., :guilabel:`BIS Billing 3.0`), then click
:guilabel:`Send & Print` to generate and attach the corresponding e-invoicing XML file.

.. _accounting/e-invoicing/peppol:

Peppol
======

The `Peppol <https://peppol.org/about/>`_ network ensures the exchange of documents and information
between companies and governmental authorities. It is primarily used for electronic invoicing, and
its access points (connectors to the Peppol network) allow companies to send electronic documents
such as customer invoices and credit notes and receive documents like vendor bills and refunds.

In this case, Odoo acts as both an **access point** and an :abbr:`SMP (Service Metadata Publisher)`
and enables electronic invoicing transactions without the need to send invoices or bills by email or
post.

.. note::
   - Make sure to :ref:`install <general/install>` the :guilabel:`Peppol` module (`account_peppol`).
   - Peppol registration is **free** and available in Odoo Community.
   - Supported formats for sending documents include **BIS Billing 3.0, XRechnung CIUS, and
     NLCIUS**.
   - | The following **countries** are eligible for **Peppol registration in Odoo**:
     | Andorra, Albania, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belgium, Bulgaria, Switzerland, Cyprus,
       Czech Republic, Germany, Denmark, Estonia, Spain, Finland, France, United Kingdom, Greece,
       Croatia, Hungary, Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Latvia,
       Monaco, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania,
       Serbia, Sweden, Slovenia, Slovakia, San Marino, Turkey, Holy See (Vatican City State)

.. _accounting/e-invoicing/peppol-registration:

Registration
------------

To register to Peppol, go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings` and scroll
to the :guilabel:`PEPPOL Electronic Document Invoicing` section.

By default, Peppol is set to demo mode in Odoo. :ref:`Demo
<accounting/e-invoicing/peppol-registration-demo>` mode simulates Peppol transactions without
affecting real data, while :ref:`production <accounting/e-invoicing/peppol-registration-production>`
mode is used in production environments.

.. _accounting/e-invoicing/peppol-registration-demo:

Demo mode
~~~~~~~~~

Registering in demo mode allows for a complete simulation of the Peppol workflow in Odoo, including
invoice sending and receiving and bill receiving. However, no communication with the Peppol network
occurs, so actions like partner verification are not performed.

The following fields in the :guilabel:`PEPPOL Electronic Document Invoicing` section are usually
prefilled with demo data. Update or complete them as needed:

- :guilabel:`Peppol EAS`: Peppol Electronic Address Scheme, which usually depends on the
  company's country. This field is often prefilled with your country's most commonly used EAS code.
  For example, the preferred EAS code for most companies in Belgium is `0208`.
- :guilabel:`Peppol Endpoint`: usually a Company Registry number or a VAT number
- :guilabel:`Mobile Number`, including the country code (e.g., `+32` in Belgium)
- :guilabel:`Primary contact email`

To set the demo mode, click :guilabel:`Validate registration (Demo)`. The :guilabel:`Application
status` is then :guilabel:`Active (Demo)`.

Test mode
~~~~~~~~~

For **advanced users only**, running tests on Peppol's test network is possible using the test mode.
The server allows users to register on Peppol and to send/receive test invoices with other
participants. To do so, follow these steps:

   :ref:`developer mode <developer-mode>`, open the Settings app, go to :menuselection:`Settings
   --> Technical --> Scheduled actions`, and search for :guilabel:`Peppol: update participant
   status`. Open the scheduled action, then click :guilabel:`Run Manually`.

.. _accounting/e-invoicing/contact-verification:

Contact verification
--------------------

Before sending an invoice to a contact using Peppol, make sure the contact is registered as a Peppol
participant. To do so, follow these steps:

#. Go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Customers --> Customers` and open the customer's form.
#. In the :guilabel:`Accounting tab`, check the following information in the :guilabel:`Electronic
   Invoicing` section:

   - :guilabel:`Format`: :guilabel:`BIS Billing 3.0`, :guilabel:`XRechnung CIUS`, or
     :guilabel:`NLCIUS`.
   - :guilabel:`Peppol e-address (EAS)`: Select the relevant EAS code in the dropdown list.
   - :guilabel:`Peppol Endpoint`: Enter the customer's endpoint identifier.

#. Click :guilabel:`Verify`. If the contact is found on the Peppol network, its :guilabel:`Peppol
   endpoint validity` is marked as :guilabel:`Valid`.

   .. image:: electronic_invoicing/customer-form.png
      :alt: verify contact registration

.. important::
   While Odoo prefills both the EAS code and the endpoint number based on the information available
   for a contact, it is recommended to verify these details directly with the contact.

.. _accounting/e-invoicing/send-invoices:

Send invoices
-------------

To set Peppol as a default format for sending invoices, go to :menuselection:`Accounting -->
Configuration --> Settings`. In the :guilabel:`Customer Invoices` section, enable the
:guilabel:`Peppol format` option and :guilabel:`Save`.

Posted invoices sent via Peppol are marked as :guilabel:`Ready to send` in the invoice's
:guilabel:`Peppol status` field.

.. note::
   All invoices that are ready to be sent via Peppol can be viewed in the following ways:

   - In the :guilabel:`Invoices` list view, use the :icon:`oi-settings-adjust` (:guilabel:`adjust
     settings`) button to add the :guilabel:`Peppol status` column or apply the :guilabel:`Peppol
     Ready` filter in the search bar.
   - In the Accounting dashboard, click :guilabel:`Peppol ready invoices` on the relevant sales
     journal.
