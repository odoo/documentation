================================================

To process an inventory adjustment by using barcodes, you first need to
open the *Barcode* app. Then, from the application, click on
*Inventory Adjustments*.

.. note::
         If you want to fully work with barcodes, you can download the sheet
         *Commands for Inventory*.

Once you have clicked on *Inventory Adjustments*, Odoo will
automatically create one. Note that, if you work with multi-location,
you first need to specify in which location the inventory adjustment
takes place.

If you donâ€™t work with multi-location, you will be able to scan the
different products you want to include in the inventory adjustment.

.. note::
         If you have 5 identical articles, scan it 5 times or use the keyboard to
         set the quantity.

Besides using the barcode scanner, you can also manually add a product
if necessary. To do so, click on *Add Product* and fill the
information in manually.

When you have scanned all the items of the location, validate the
inventory manually or scan the *Validate* barcode.
