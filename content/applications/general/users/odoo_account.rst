Odoo.com account changes
========================

This documentation is dedicated to edits made to an Odoo.com account. The following processes
describe how to delete an Odoo.com account, and how to change the password on an Odoo.com account.

Delete Odoo.com account
=======================

To delete an Odoo.com account, start by clicking the profile icon in the upper-right corner
(represented by the username and icon) to reveal a drop-down menu. From the drop-down menu, select
:guilabel:`My Odoo.com account`, which reveals the user portal.

From the user portal, the delete option can be accessed by going to :menuselection:`My Account -->
Edit Security Settings --> Delete Account`. It can also be accessed by going to
`https://www.odoo.com/my/home <https://www.odoo.com/my/home>`_.

.. danger::
   Deleting an Odoo account is irreversible. Be careful performing this action, as the Odoo.com
   account is **not** retrievable once deleted.

Upon clicking the :guilabel:`Delete Account` button, a pop-up window appears, requesting
confirmation for the account deletion.

To change the Odoo.com password, click on the :guilabel:`Edit Security Settings` link, below the
:menuselection:`Account Security` section. Next, make the necessary changes by typing in the current

   Passwords for Odoo.com users and portal users remain separate, even if the same email address is
   used.

To add two-factor authentication, login into the Odoo.com user account from the Odoo.com login page.
After logging-in, go to the upper-right corner of the screen, and click the :guilabel:`▼ (down
arrow)` icon next to the :guilabel:`profile icon`. Then, select :guilabel:`My Account`, and a portal
dashboard appears.

If the user would like to turn on two-factor authentication (2FA) for Odoo.com access, click on the
:guilabel:`Edit Security Settings` link below the :menuselection:`Account Security` section.

Click on :guilabel:`Enable two-factor authentication` to turn on :abbr:`2FA (two-factor
authentication)`. Then, confirm the current password in the :guilabel:`Password` field. Next, click
on :guilabel:`Confirm Password`. Following that, activate :abbr:`2FA (two-factor authentication)` in
a :abbr:`2FA (two-factor authentication)` app (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.), by scanning the
:guilabel:`QR code` or entering a :guilabel:`Verification Code`.

Finally, click on :guilabel:`Enable two-factor authentication` to complete the setup.
