Connect a Scale
===============

When using your **IoT Box** in Odoo, you could need to use a scale. Doing so is easy and convenient
as it can be done in a few steps. Then, you can use it in your **Point of Sale app** to weigh your
products, which is helpful if their price are based on it.

Connection
==========

To link the scale to the **IoT Box**, connect them with a cable.

.. note::
   In some cases, a serial to USB adapter may be needed.

If your scale is `compatibale with Odoo IoT Box <https://www.odoo.com/page/iot-hardware>`_, there
is no need to set up anything because it will be automatically detected as soon as it is connected.

You may need to restart the box and download your scalesâ€™ drivers from the box in some cases. To do
so, go to the *IoT Box Home Page* and click on *drivers list*. Then, click on load drivers.

The scale is now available in all your *PoS* sessions. Then, if a product has a price per weight
set, clicking on it on the *PoS* screen opens the scale screen, where the cashier can weigh the
product and add the correct price to the cart.
