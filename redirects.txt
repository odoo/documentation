# REDIRECT RULES #

# Each line in this file specifies a redirect rule that redirects users from one URL to another.
#
# Redirect rules must follow this pattern: old_file.rst new_file.rst  # optional comment
# Both parts are file paths and must thus include the full path of the file starting from the root
# of the documentation to the file name, including the .rst extension.
# If you consider it necessary, add a comment after the symbol '#' to explain why the redirection is
# needed.
#
# A redirect rule must be added to this file in the following cases:
#
#   1. An RST file is moved from one location to another.
#      Example: The TOC of the Sales app is moved into a file index.rst located in sales/ .
#      Rule: sales.rst sales/index.rst
#
#   2. An RST file is renamed.
#      Example: The file create_quotations.rst in sales/ is renamed to quotations.rst.
#      Rule: sales/create_quotations.rst sales/quotations.rst # no longer limited to creating quotes
#
#   3. Another pertinent case.
#      Example: The file open_order_line_popup.rst is removed from sales/ in 13.0.
#      Rule (13.0 only): sales/open_order_line_popup.rst sales/orders.rst # feature replaced in 13.0
#
# Note that if the old file was already present in previous versions, the rule needs to be added
# from the branch of the lowest of those versions (usually 11.0) to allow the version switcher to
# land on the correct page (the redirection will be duplicated in other branches).
