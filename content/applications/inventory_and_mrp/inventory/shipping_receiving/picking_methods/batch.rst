Batch picking
=============

.. _inventory/misc/batch_picking:

*Batch picking* enables a single picker to handle multiple orders at once, reducing the time needed
to navigate to the same location in a warehouse.

When picking in batches, orders are grouped and consolidated into a picking list. After the picking,
the batch is taken to an output location, where the products are sorted into their respective
delivery packages.

.. seealso::
   :ref:`Use Barcode app for pickings <inventory/warehouses_storage/barcode_picking>`

Since orders *must* be sorted at the output location after being picked, this picking method suits
businesses with a few products that are ordered often. Storing high-demand items in easily
accessible locations can increase the number of orders that are fulfilled efficiently.

Configuration
=============

To activate the batch picking option, begin by going to :menuselection:`Inventory app -->
Configuration --> Settings`. Under the :guilabel:`Operations` section, check the :guilabel:`Batch
Transfers` box.

   :alt: Enable the *Batch Transfers* in Inventory > Configuration > Settings.

Since batch picking is a method to optimize the *pick* operation in Odoo, the :guilabel:`Storage
Locations` and :guilabel:`Multi-Step Routes` options under the :guilabel:`Warehouse` heading must
also be checked on this settings page. When finished, click :guilabel:`Save`.

.. image:: batch/locations-routes-checkbox.png

   :alt: Enable *Storage Locations* and *Multi-Step Routes* Inventory > Configuration > Settings.

Lastly, enable the warehouse picking feature, by navigating to the warehouse settings page, which is
accessible from :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Warehouses`.

From here, select the desired warehouse from the list. Then, from the radio options available for
:guilabel:`Outgoing Shipments`, select either the :guilabel:`Send goods in output and then deliver
(2 steps)` or :guilabel:`Pack goods, send goods in output and then deliver (3 steps)`.

Create batch transfers
======================

Manually create batch transfers directly from the :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Operations -->
Batch Transfers` page. Click the :guilabel:`New` button to begin creating a batch transfer.

On the batch transfer form, fill the following fields out accordingly:

- :guilabel:`Responsible`: employee assigned to the picking. Leave this field blank if *any* worker
  can fulfill this picking.
- :guilabel:`Operation Type`: from the drop-down menu, select the operation type under which the
  picking is categorized.
- :guilabel:`Scheduled Date`: specifies the date by which the :guilabel:`Responsible` person should
  complete the transfer to the output location.

Next, in the :guilabel:`Transfers` list, click :guilabel:`Add a line` to open the :guilabel:`Add:
Transfers` window.

If the :guilabel:`Operation Type` field was filled, the list will filter transfer records matching
the selected :guilabel:`Operation Type`.

Click the :guilabel:`New` button to create a new transfer.

Once the transfer records are selected, click :guilabel:`Confirm` to confirm the batch picking.

.. example::
   A new batch transfer assigned to the :guilabel:`Responsible`, `Joel Willis`, for the `Pick`
   :guilabel:`Operation Type`. The :guilabel:`Scheduled Date` is set to `August 11`.

   .. image:: batch/batch-transfer-form.png
      :align: center
      :alt: View of *Batch Transfers* form.

   Clicking the :guilabel:`Add a line` button opens the :guilabel:`Add:Transfers` window,
   displaying only pickings. This is because the :guilabel:`Operation Type` was set to `Pick` on the
   batch transfer form.

   Click the checkbox to the left of the transfers, `WH/PICK/00001` and `WH/PICK/00002`, to include
   them in the new transfer. Then, click the :guilabel:`Select` button to close the
   :guilabel:`Add:Transfers` window.

   .. image:: batch/add-transfers-window.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Select multiple transfers from the *Add:Transfers* window.

.. _inventory/warehouses_storage/add-batch-transfers:

Add batch from transfers list
-----------------------------

Another method of creating batch transfers is available using the :guilabel:`Add to batch` option in
a list. Navigate to the :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Operations` drop-down menu, and select any
of the :guilabel:`Transfers` to open a filtered list of transfers.

.. image:: batch/transfers-drop-down.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Show all transfer types in a drop-down menu: Receipts, Deliveries, Internal Transfers,
         Manufacturings, Batch Transfers, Dropships.

On the transfers list, select the checkbox to the left of the selected transfers to add in a batch.
Next, navigate to the :guilabel:`Actions ⚙️ (gear)` button, and click :guilabel:`Add to batch` from
the resulting drop-down menu.

.. image:: batch/add-to-batch.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Use *Add to batch* button, from the *Action* button's list.

Doing so opens an :guilabel:`Add to batch` pop-up window, wherein the employee
:guilabel:`Responsible` for the picking can be assigned.

Choose from the two radio options to add to :guilabel:`an existing batch transfer` or create
:guilabel:`a new batch transfer`.

To begin with a draft, select the :guilabel:`Draft` checkbox.

Conclude the process by clicking :guilabel:`Confirm`.

Process batch transfer
======================

Handle batch transfers in the :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Operations --> Batch Transfers`
page.

From here, select the intended transfer from the list. Then, on the batch transfer form, input the
:guilabel:`Done` quantities for each product, under the :guilabel:`Detailed Operations` tab.
Finally, select :guilabel:`Validate` to complete the picking.

.. tip::
   Be certain the batch transfer is complete when the :guilabel:`Validate` button is highlighted in
   purple. If the :guilabel:`Check Availability` button is highlighted instead, that means there are
   items in the batch that are currently *not* available in-stock.

.. _inventory/management/batch-transfers-example:

.. example::
   In a batch transfer involving products from pickings, `WH/PICK/00001` and `WH/PICK/00002`, the
   :guilabel:`Detailed Operations` tab shows that the product, `Cabinet with Doors`, has been picked
   because the :guilabel:`Done` column matches the value in the :guilabel:`Reserved` column.
   However, `0.00` quantities have been picked for the other product, `Cable Management Box`.

   .. image:: batch/process-batch-transfer.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Show batch transfer of products from two pickings in the *Detailed Operations* tab.

Only in-stock products are visible in the :guilabel:`Detailed Operations` tab.

To view the complete product list, switch to the :guilabel:`Operations` tab. On this list, the
:guilabel:`Demand` column indicates the required quantity for the order. The :guilabel:`Reserved`
column shows the available stock to fulfill the order. Lastly, the :guilabel:`Done` column specifies
the products that have been picked, and are ready for the next step.

.. example::
   The product, `Desk Pad`, from the same batch as the :ref:`example above
   <inventory/management/batch-transfers-example>`, is only visible in the :guilabel:`Operations`
   tab because there are no :guilabel:`Reserved` quantities in-stock to fulfill the batch picking.

   Click the :guilabel:`Check Availability` button to search the stock again for available products.

   .. image:: batch/operations-tab.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Show unavailable reserved quantities in the *Operations* tab.

Create backorder
----------------

On the batch transfer form, if the :guilabel:`Done` quantity of the product is *less* than the
:guilabel:`Reserved` quantity, a pop-up window appears.

This pop-up window provides the option: :guilabel:`Create Backorder?`.

Clicking the :guilabel:`Create Backorder` button automatically creates a new batch transfer,
containing the remaining products.

Click :guilabel:`No Backorder` to finish the picking *without* creating another batch picking.

Click :guilabel:`Discard` to cancel the validation, and return to the batch transfer form.

.. image:: batch/create-backorder.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Show the *Create Backorder* pop-up.

.. _inventory/warehouses_storage/barcode_picking:

Process batch transfer: Barcode app
===================================

Created batch transfers are also listed in the :menuselection:`Barcode` app, accessible by selecting
the :guilabel:`Batch Transfers` button.

By default, confirmed batch pickings appear on the :guilabel:`Batch Transfers` page. On that page,
click on the desired batch transfer to open the detailed list of products for the picking.

.. image:: batch/barcode-batch-transfers.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Show list of to-do batch transfers in *Barcode* app.

For the chosen batch transfer, follow the instructions at the top of the page in the black
background. Begin by scanning the product's barcode to record a single product for picking. To
record multiple quantities, click the :guilabel:`✏️ (pencil)` icon, and enter the required
quantities for the picking.

.. note::
   Products from the same order are labeled with the same color on the left. Completed pickings are
   highlighted in green.

.. example::
   In a batch transfer for 2 `Cabinet with Doors`, 3 `Acoustic Bloc Screens`, and 4 `Four Person
   Desks`, the `3/3` and `4/4` :guilabel:`Units` indicate that the last two product pickings are
   complete.

   `1/2` units of the `Cabinet with Doors` has already been picked, and after scanning the product
   barcode for the second cabinet, Odoo prompts the user to `Scan a serial number` to record the
   unique serial number for :ref:`product tracking <inventory/product_management/configure-lots>`.

   .. image:: batch/barcode-products.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Display products to be picked in barcode view.

Once all the products have been picked, click on :guilabel:`Validate` to mark the batch transfer as
:guilabel:`Done`.
