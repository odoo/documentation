Calendar
========

Odoo **Calendar** is a scheduling app that allows users to integrate a company's business flow into
a single management platform. By integrating with the other apps in Odoo's ecosystem, **Calendar**
allows users to schedule and organize meetings, schedule events, plan employee appraisals,
coordinate projects, and more â€“ all from the same platform.

Upon opening the :menuselection:`Calendar app`, users have an overview of their current meetings.
The selected view option appears as a :guilabel:`Day`, :guilabel:`Week`, :guilabel:`Month`, or
:guilabel:`Year` drop-down menu. Under the view options drop-down menu, users can also enable or
disable :guilabel:`Show weekends`.

.. tip::
   Depending on the selected view option, users can click the :icon:`oi-arrow-left`
   :icon:`oi-arrow-right` :guilabel:`(left or right arrow)` buttons to switch between days, weeks,
   etc., and switch back to the current day with the :guilabel:`Today` button.

Sync third-party calendars
--------------------------

Users can sync Odoo with existing :doc:`Outlook <calendar/outlook>` and/or
:doc:`Google <calendar/google>` calendars, by heading to
:menuselection:`Calendar app --> Configuration --> Settings`. From here, enter
:guilabel:`Client ID` and :guilabel:`Client Secret`. There is also an option to pause
synchronization by ticking the checkbox, or automating synchronization by keeping it blank.

Once the desired configurations are complete, be sure to click :guilabel:`Save` before moving on.

Events created in synced calendars automatically appear across the integrated platforms.

Create activities from chatter
------------------------------

Instantly create new meetings anywhere in Odoo through an individual record's chatter, like
in a **CRM** opportunity card or task in the **Projects** app.

From the chatter, click on the :guilabel:`Activities` button. In the :guilabel:`Schedule Activity`
pop-up window, select the desired :guilabel:`Activity Type`, which populates a set of buttons,
depending on the activity.

Activities that involve other schedules, like :guilabel:`Meeting` or :guilabel:`Call for Demo`, link
to the **Calendar** app. Select one of these activities to link to the **Calendar** app, then hit
:guilabel:`Open Calendar` to navigate back to the app. Alternatively, it is also possible to
:guilabel:`Schedule & Mark as Done` to close out the activity, or select :guilabel:`Done & Schedule
Next` to keep the :guilabel:`Schedule Activity` window open to create another.

Tick the :guilabel:`All Day` checkbox if there is no specific start or end time.

For events with specific start and stop times, ensure the :guilabel:`All Day` checkbox is unticked

the :guilabel:`Start` field.

The signed-in user auto-populates as the first attendee. Additional :guilabel:`Attendees` can be
added or created from here, as well.

    meeting should recur.
