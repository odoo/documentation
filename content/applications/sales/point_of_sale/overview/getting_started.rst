Getting started
===============

When working with a Point of Sale application, employees want a
simple, and user-friendly solution. A solution that works online or
offline and with any device.

A Point of Sale system is a fully integrated application that allows any transaction, 
automatically registers product moves in your stock, and gives you
real-time statistics and consolidations across all shops.

Configuration
=============

Make products available in the PoS
----------------------------------

To make products available for sale, go to :menuselection:`Point of
Sale --> Products --> Products` and open a product. In the *Sales*
tab, enable *Available in Point of Sale*.

Configure your payment methods

To add a payment method, you first need to create it. Go to
:menuselection:`Point of Sale --> Configuration --> Payment Methods`
and click on create. Then, you can name your payment method and set it
up.

Sale` and open the PoS in which you want to include the payment method. Then, add the
payment method.

Once an order is completed, you can register the payment. All the
available payment methods appear on the left of the screen. Select the payment
method and enter the received amount. Then, you can validate the
payment.

Return and refund products
--------------------------

Having a well-thought-out return policy is key to keep customers satisfied and make the process 
of accepting returns and refunds easy for you.

To do that, from the PoS interface, select the product and quantity (with the +/- button) that the 
customer wants to return. For multiple products, repeat the process individually.

.. tip::
   It’s strongly advised to close your PoS session at the end of each day.

Once a session is closed, you can see a summary of all transactions per payment method. 
Then, click on a line to see all orders that were paid during your PoS session. 
If everything is correct, validate the session and post the closing entries.
