Git guidelines
==============

.. _contributing/git_guidelines/configure_git:

Configure your git
------------------

Based on ancestral experience and oral tradition, the following things go a long
way towards making your commits more helpful:

- Be sure to define both the user.email and user.name in your local git config

  .. code-block:: text

     git config --global <var> <value>

- Be sure to add your full name to your Github profile here. Please feel fancy
  and add your team, avatar, your favorite quote, and whatnot ;-)

.. _contributing/git_guidelines/message_structure:

Commit message structure
------------------------

Commit message has four parts: tag, module, short description and full
description. Try to follow the preferred structure for your commit messages

.. code-block:: text

  [TAG] module: describe your change in a short sentence (ideally < 50 chars)

  Long version of the change description, including the rationale for the change,
  or a summary of the feature being introduced.

  Please spend a lot more time describing WHY the change is being done rather
  than WHAT is being changed. This is usually easy to grasp by actually reading
  the diff. WHAT should be explained only if there are technical choices
  or decision involved. In that case explain WHY this decision was taken.

  End the message with references, such as task or bug numbers, PR numbers, and
  OPW tickets, following the suggested format:
  task-123 (related to task)
  Fixes #123  (close related issue on Github)
  Closes #123  (close related PR on Github)
  opw-123 (related to ticket)

.. _contributing/git_guidelines/commit_tag_module:

Tag and module name
-------------------

Tags are used to prefix your commit. They should be one of the following

- **[FIX]** for bug fixes: mostly used in stable version but also valid if you
  are fixing a recent bug in development version;
- **[REF]** for refactoring: when a feature is heavily rewritten;
- **[ADD]** for adding new modules;
- **[REM]** for removing resources: removing dead code, removing views,
  removing modules, ...;
- **[REV]** for reverting commits: if a commit causes issues or is not wanted
  reverting it is done using this tag;
- **[MOV]** for moving files: use git move and do not change content of moved file
  otherwise Git may loose track and history of the file; also used when moving
  code from one file to another;
- **[REL]** for release commits: new major or minor stable versions;
- **[IMP]** for improvements: most of the changes done in development version
  are incremental improvements not related to another tag;
- **[MERGE]** for merge commits: used in forward port of bug fixes but also as
  main commit for feature involving several separated commits;
- **[CLA]** for signing the Odoo Individual Contributor License;
- **[I18N]** for changes in translation files;
- **[PERF]** for performance patches;

After tag comes the modified module name. Use the technical name as functional
name may change with time. If several modules are modified, list them or use
various to tell it is cross-modules. Unless really required or easier avoid
modifying code across several modules in the same commit. Understanding module
history may become difficult.

.. _contributing/git_guidelines/commit_header:

Commit message header
---------------------

After tag and module name comes a meaningful commit message header. It should be
self explanatory and include the reason behind the change. Do not use single words
like "bugfix" or "improvements". Try to limit the header length to about 50 characters
for readability.

Commit message header should make a valid sentence once concatenated with
``if applied, this commit will <header>``. For example ``[IMP] base: prevent to
archive users linked to active partners`` is correct as it makes a valid sentence
``if applied, this commit will prevent users to archive...``.

.. _contributing/git_guidelines/commit_body:

Commit message full description
-------------------------------

In the message description specify the part of the code impacted by your changes
(module name, lib, transversal object, ...) and a description of the changes.

First explain WHY you are modifying code. What is important if someone goes back
to your commit in about 4 decades (or 3 days) is why you did it. It is the
purpose of the change.

What you did can be found in the commit itself. If there was some technical choices
involved it is a good idea to explain it also in the commit message after the why.
For Odoo R&D developers "PO team asked me to do it" is not a valid why, by the way.

Please avoid commits which simultaneously impact multiple modules. Try to split
into different commits where impacted modules are different. It will be helpful
if we need to revert changes in a given module separately.

Don't hesitate to be a bit verbose. Most people will only see your commit message
and judge everything you did in your life just based on those few sentences.
No pressure at all.

**You spend several hours, days or weeks working on meaningful features. Take
some time to calm down and write clear and understandable commit messages.**

If you are an Odoo R&D developer the WHY should be the purpose of the task you
are working on. Full specifications make the core of the commit message.
**If you are working on a task that lacks purpose and specifications please
consider making them clear before continuing.**

Finally here are some examples of correct commit messages :

.. code-block:: text

 [REF] models: use `parent_path` to implement parent_store

  This replaces the former modified preorder tree traversal (MPTT) with the
  fields `parent_left`/`parent_right`[...]

 [FIX] account: remove frenglish

  [...]

  Closes #22793
  Fixes #22769

 [FIX] website: remove unused alert div, fixes look of input-group-btn

  Bootstrap's CSS depends on the input-group-btn
  element being the first/last child of its parent.
  This was not the case because of the invisible
  and useless alert.

.. note:: Use the long description to explain the *why* not the
          *what*, the *what* can be seen in the diff
