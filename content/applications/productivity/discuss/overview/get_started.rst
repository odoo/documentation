Start Chatting
==============

The first time you log in to your account, OdooBot sends you a message asking for permission to
receive desktop notifications to chats. If accepted, you receive push notifications to the messages
sent to you despite of where you are in Odoo.

Mentions in the chat and on the Chatter
---------------------------------------

.. tip::
   When a user is mentioned, the search list (list of names) suggests values first based on the
   task’s followers, and secondly on *Employees*. If the record being searched does not match with
   either a follower or employee, the scope of the search becomes all partners.

Chat status
-----------

It is helpful to see what colleagues are up to and how quickly they can respond to messages by
checking their *Status*. The status is shown on the left side of a contact’s names on Discuss’
sidebar and on the *Messaging menu*.

- Green = online
- Orange = away
- White = offline
- Airplane = out of the office
