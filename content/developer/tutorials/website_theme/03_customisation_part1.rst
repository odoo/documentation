Add custom SCSS
===============

You've adjusted Odoo and Bootstrap variables and set presets, yet you still notice disparities
between your website and the client's design. The only solution is to incorporate custom SCSS.

In :file:`theme.scss`, reproduce the following design elements:

- Add a **green underline** on active nav items.
- Modify the **arrow** for collapsible nav items.
- Modify the **slider's arrows** by adding a green background and changing their design.

You will find the various `media here
<{GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/static/src/img/content/icons>`_.

.. seealso::
   See reference documentation on how to :ref:`add your SCSS rules <theming/assets/styles>`.

   :scale: 50%

.. image:: 03_customisation_part1/slider.png

.. note::
   | It's always preferable to include all your SCSS rules in `#wrapwrap`. This ID is applied to the
     div that groups the :guilabel:`header`, :guilabel:`footer`, and :guilabel:`main` content of all
     your pages.
   | So you will be sure that your rules will only have an impact on the website parts.

Add custom JS
=============

Now, let's add a mouse follower to the website. This interactive element will enhance the browsing
experience, making it more engaging and visually appealing.

.. _tutorials/website_theme/customisation_part1/custom_header:

Create a custom header
======================

With variables, presets, and custom SCSS in place, it's time to refine the layout and add key
cross-page elements, starting with the header.

Based on the Airproof design, create a custom header with the following elements:

- A centered logo. Ensure to declare the logo so that it appears automatically in the header.
- A custom shopping cart icon.
- A login/user as a button.
- Navigation text to 14px.

You can find the `logo
<{GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/static/src/img/content/branding/airproof-logo.svg>`_,
`cart icon <{GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/static/src/img/content/icons/shopping.svg>`_ and
`template illustration
<{GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/static/src/img/wbuilder/template-header-opt.svg>`_.

.. seealso::
   See reference documentation on how to:

   - create :ref:`custom headers <website_themes/layout/header/custom>`,
   - do a :ref:`website_themes/layout/xpath`,
   - declare a :ref:`website_themes/media/images/use/logo`.

.. image:: 03_customisation_part1/header.png

.. tip::
   - Base yourself on the code of existing header templates that you can find in
     `odoo/addons/website/views/website_templates.xml
     <{GITHUB_PATH}/addons/website/views/website_templates.xml>`_.
   - A good practise should be to create different files to manage your custom views and templates.
     For example, everything concerning the general layout (header, footer...) in
     :file:`website_templates.xml`, everything related to blog in :file:`website_blog_templates.xml`,
     to event in :file:`website_event_templates.xml`, etc.
   - | To modify the cart icon, you can use an `XPath`.
     | Since this is linked to eCommerce, place it in a new file called
       :file:`website_sale_templates.xml`.
   - Don't forget to continue making as many modifications as you can through the :file:`Bootstrap
     variables` and :file:`primary variables` (font, colors, size...). You can use them to help you
     with this exercise.

   Find the solution in our Airproof example for:

   - the xml structure and to add the template to the options list on
     `website_template.xml <{GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/views/website_templates.xml>`_.
   - disable the default header:

     .. code-block:: xml
        :caption: ``/website_airproof/data/presets.xml``

        <!-- Disable default header -->
        <record id="website.template_header_default" model="ir.ui.view">
           <field name="active" eval="False"/>
        </record>

   - record the logo:

     .. code-block:: xml
        :caption: ``/website_airproof/data/images.xml``

        <!-- Set as the logo of the website -->
        <record id="website.default_website" model="website">
           <field name="logo" type="base64" file="website_airproof/static/src/img/content/branding/airproof-logo.svg"/>
        </record>

   - declare your :file:`website_templates.xml` file along with all the new ones in your
     :file:`manifest`.
   - disable the options you donâ€™t want in your header via the `presets
     <{GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/data/presets.xml>`_.
   - make the use of `primaries
     <{GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/static/src/scss/primary_variables.scss>`_ like
     `header-template`, `navbar-font`, `header-font-size`...
   - use `bootstrap_overridden
     <{GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/static/src/scss/bootstrap_overridden.scss>`_ like
     `$navbar-light-color`, `$navbar-light-hover-color`, `$navbar-padding-y`...
   - add some `scss <{GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/static/src/scss/layout/header.scss>`_
     rules.

.. _tutorials/website_theme/customisation_part1/custom_footer:

Create a custom footer
======================

The client is delighted with the new header, as it aligns perfectly with the provided design. Now,
he wants a matching custom footer.

Based on the Airproof design, create a custom footer with the following elements:

- A section for newsletter subscription.
- A section for the copyright and social media.

You will find the `icons here <{GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/static/src/img/content/icons>`_.

.. seealso::
   See reference documentation on how to create a :ref:`custom footer
   <website_themes/layout/footer/custom>` and adapt the :ref:`website_themes/layout/copyright`.

.. image:: 03_customisation_part1/footer.png

.. tip::
   - You can enable or disable the copyright section via the presets.
   - For the newsletter section to work, you need to install the `website_mass_mailing` application.

.. spoiler:: Solutions

   To complete this exercise, you need to:

   - add `mass mailing` to your depends:

     .. code-block:: python
         :caption: ``/website_airproof/__manifest__.py``

         'depends': ['website_sale', 'website_sale_wishlist', 'website_blog',
         'website_mass_mailing'],

   - find the xml structure and add the template to the options list on
     `website_template.xml <{GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/views/website_templates.xml>`_.
   - disable the default footer and enable the copyright:

     .. code-block:: xml
        :caption: ``/website_airproof/data/presets.xml``

        <!-- Disable Default Footer -->
        <record id="website.footer_custom" model="ir.ui.view">
           <field name="active" eval="False"/>
        </record>
        <!-- Enable Copyright -->
        <record id="website.footer_no_copyright" model="ir.ui.view">
           <field name="active" eval="False"/>
        </record>

   - make the use of `primaries
     <{GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/static/src/scss/primary_variables.scss>`_ like
     `footer-template`, `footer`, `o-cc4-link`...
   - add a little scss rule for the `newsletter
     <{GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/static/src/scss/snippets/newsletter.scss>`_ section.

Create a new dynamic snippets template
======================================

| Dynamic snippets are useful building blocks. These allow you to fetch information from the backend
  and display it on the website according to certain filters.
| There are already several layout templates for displaying dynamic snippets. However, none of the
  existing templates fully match your client's needs.

Based on the Airproof design, create a custom template that you will apply to a product dynamic
snippet on the homepage.

#. First, create a custom template that will be added to the list of dynamic products templates. It
   has to include the following elements:

   - Add a :guilabel:`Discover more` link.
   - Add a hover effect on cards.
   - Move the navigation arrows.

   You will find the `icons here <{GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/static/src/img/content/icons>`_.

   .. tip::
      You can verify in the Website Builder that your template appears in the list of available
      templates for the product dynamic snippet.

#. Then, add a product dynamic snippet with the template you just created to the homepage.
