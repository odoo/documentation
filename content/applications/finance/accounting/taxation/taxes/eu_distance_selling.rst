EU intra-community Distance Selling
===================================

**Distance sales within the European Union** include cross-border sales of goods and services to a
private consumer (B2C) in another EU Member State when the seller doesn't meet face-to-face with the
customer. Organizations must ensure that the VAT on distance sales is paid to the Member State in
which the goods or services are delivered.

.. note::
   This remains true even if your organization is located outside of the European Union.

While this regulation mainly applies to :doc:`eCommerce <../../../../websites/ecommerce>` sales to
private EU consumers, it is also valid for mail order sales and telesales.

The Union **One-Stop Shop (OSS)** is an online portal where businesses can register for the OSS and
declare their intra-community distance sales. Each EU member states integrates an online OSS portal.

The **EU intra-community Distance Selling** feature helps your organization comply with this
regulation by creating and configuring new :doc:`fiscal positions <fiscal_positions>` and
:doc:`taxes <taxes>` based on your company's country.
