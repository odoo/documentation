Tags work like keywords or labels that will help you to categorize your work, as well as make
objectives and goals clearer and available for everyone instantly. They are also a useful source of
filtering, helping you boost productivity.


Where can I use and how do I create tags?
=========================================

| Tags can be used in numerous applications going from *CRM*, *Project*, *Contacts*, *Marketing
  Automation*, etc.
| On *CRM* for instance, under :menuselection:`CRM --> Configuration --> Tags` you can create new or
  edit existing ones.
