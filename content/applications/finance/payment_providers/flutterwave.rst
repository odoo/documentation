   .. important::
      If you choose to allow saving payment methods, it is recommended to only enable card payments
      from Flutterwave dashboard, as only cards can be saved as payment tokens. To do so, go to your
      Flutterwave Dashboard and then to :menuselection:`Settings --> Account Settings`.
