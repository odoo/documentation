==========================
Use Web Push Notifications
==========================

Web Push Notifications deliver messages to your userâ€™s device without the need to be on your
website, or for them to give personal information. They can be used to inform your users about news,
articles and content posted, practical messages like traffic and weather updates,
flight information, sales alerts, coupons, and product updates.

Ask users for permission
========================

In the *Website* application go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings`
and enable *Web Push Notifications*.

Choose your message, icon, and delay time (which is the wait time for the permission request to be
shown once the user lands on your page).
