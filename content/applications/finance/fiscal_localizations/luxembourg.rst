.. _localizations/luxembourg/tax-reporting:

Tax reporting
=============

In Luxembourg, companies must submit a VAT declaration on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis to
the tax office, depending on their turnover. Companies that submit a monthly or quarterly
declaration are also required to submit the annual declaration.

Both monthly/quarterly and annual VAT declarations can be exported as XML files to upload on the
:abbr:`eCDF platform (plateforme électronique de Collecte des Données Financières)`.

Monthly / quarterly declaration
-------------------------------

Go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Reporting --> Tax Report`.

In the :icon:`fa-book` :guilabel:`Report` selector, select :guilabel:`Tax Report (LU)`.

In the :icon:`fa-calendar` (:guilabel:`Period`) selector, choose the month or quarter for which to
generate the declaration.

Check the amounts generated for all four sections of the report.

If you sold to customers under a VAT exemption for SMEs during the period, you need to manually
enter the value of such sales in the editable fields at section I, items 481 and 482. To find the
amounts for these items, you can use the :guilabel:`Partner Ledger` report:

- Go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Reporting --> Partner Ledger`.
- In the :icon:`fa-calendar` (:guilabel:`Period`) selector, choose the appropriate month or
  quarter.
- In the :icon:`fa-user` (:guilabel:`Account`) selector, choose :guilabel:`Receivable`.
- In the :icon:`fa-folder-open` (:guilabel:`Partners`) selector, choose the partners which fall
  under the exemption.
- Copy the total :guilabel:`Balance` for those partners for the given period.

Once the declaration is correct, click on the :icon:`fa-cog` (:guilabel:`action menu`) icon, then
click :guilabel:`XML` to export and download it in XML format. You can then submit the XML file on
the eCDF platform.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following configuration allows values to be generated automatically for sections I and III, and
Appendix A of the report, based on journal entries that affect accounts dedicated to each report

Opening the declaration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Reporting --> Tax Report`.

In the :icon:`fa-book` :guilabel:`Report` selector, select :guilabel:`Annual VAT Declaration (LU)`.

In the :icon:`fa-calendar` (:guilabel:`Period`) selector, choose the fiscal year dates for which to
generate the declaration.

Completing the declaration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The annual declaration contains five sections labelled I to V, seven appendices labelled A to G, and
an additional Appendix to Operational Expenditures.

Sections I and III, and Appendix A can be pre-populated automatically based on the :ref:`account tag
configuration <luxembourg/account-tag-configuration>`. After configuring the account tags,
:ref:`set the tax lock date <tax-returns/lock-date>` to the end of the fiscal year. This will
trigger the pre-computation of those values.

Alternatively, the year's total VAT debit and credit can be manually distributed among the various
report lines in sections I and III. You can use the :icon:`fa-pencil` (:guilabel:`Edit`) icon to
manually enter the value for each report line.

Sections II and IV are automatically computed.

You then need to manually complete appendices B through G, as well as the Appendix to Operational
Expenditures with any additional information to be reported.

Exporting the declaration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the declaration is complete and correct, click on the :icon:`fa-cog` (:guilabel:`action menu`)
