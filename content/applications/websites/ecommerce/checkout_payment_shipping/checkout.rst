Checkout
========

Once customers have added their desired products to the cart, they can access it by clicking the
:icon:`fa-shopping-cart` button in the header to start the checkout process. In Odoo eCommerce, this
process consists of sequential :ref:`steps <ecommerce/checkout/steps>`, some of which support
additional features. The related checkout pages can be :ref:`customized
<ecommerce/checkout/customize_steps>` using the website editor.

.. _ecommerce/checkout/policy:

Checkout policy
===============

To allow customers to checkout as guests or force them to sign in/create an account, go to
:menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings`, scroll down to the
:guilabel:`Shop - Checkout Process` section, and configure the :guilabel:`Sign in/up at checkout`
setting. The following options are available:

- :guilabel:`Optional`: Customers can check out as guests and register later via the order
  confirmation email to track their order.
- :guilabel:`Disabled (buy as guest)`: Customers can checkout as guests without creating an account.
- :guilabel:`Mandatory (no guest checkout)`: Customers must sign in or create an account at
  the :ref:`Review Order <ecommerce/checkout/review_order>` step to complete their purchase.

#. Go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings`, and in the
   :guilabel:`Shop - Checkout Process` section, enable the
   :ref:`Mandatory (no guest checkout) <ecommerce/checkout/policy>` option.
#. Scroll down to the :guilabel:`Privacy` section, go to :guilabel:`Customer Account`, and select
   :guilabel:`On invitation`.
#. Go to :menuselection:`Website --> eCommerce --> Customers`, switch to the :guilabel:`List` view,
   and select the customers you wish to grant access to your
   :doc:`portal <../../../general/users/portal>`.
#. Click the :icon:`fa-cog` :guilabel:`Actions` button, then :guilabel:`Grant portal access`.
#. Review the selected customers in the :guilabel:`Portal Access Management` pop-up and click

instructions on setting a password and activating their account.

.. note::
   - You can revoke access or re-invite a customer using the related buttons in the
     :guilabel:`Portal Access Management` pop-up.
   - Users can only have one :doc:`portal access <../../../general/users/portal>` per email.

     B2B website with mandatory sign-in.

     :ref:`express checkout <payment_providers/express_checkout>`, a dedicated button is displayed,
     allowing customers to go straight from the cart to the confirmation page without filling out
