==================================================
Batch Payments: Batch Deposits (checks, cash etc.)
==================================================

A **Batch Deposit** groups multiple payments in a single batch. This allows you to deposit several
payments into your bank account with a single transaction. This is particularly useful to deposit
cash and checks.

This feature allows you to list several customer payments and print a **deposit slip**. This ticket
contains the details of the transactions and a reference to the batch deposit. You can then select
this reference during a bank reconciliation to match the single bank statement line with all the
transactions listed in the batch deposit.

Configuration
=============

To activate the feature, go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings -->
Customer Payments`, activate **Batch Payments**, and click on *Save*.

Payment Method Types
--------------------

To record new payments as part of a Batch Deposit, you have to configure first the Journal on which
you record them.

To do so, go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals`, open the Journal
you want to edit, click on *Edit*, and open the *Advanced Settings* tab. In the *Payment Method
Types* section, enable **Batch Deposit**, and click on *Save*.

*Batch Payment* reference. To do so, start your **Bank Reconciliation** by going to your Accounting
dashboard and clicking on *Reconcile Items* on the related bank account. At the bank statement line,
click on *Choose counterpart or Create Write-off* to display more options, open the *Batch Payments*
tab, and select your Batch Payment. All related payments are automatically added.

.. note::
   The *Batch Payments* tab won't appear if a Partner is selected for this bank statement line.

payment before validating the bank reconciliation.
