Share Projects and Tasks
========================

When you share your projects/tasks, you allow external users to be on the same page as you.
It avoids misunderstandings, simplifies communication, and allows you to become a more coordinated
company as you get the right information to the right people.

Share projects and tasks
========================

To share a project, go to :menuselection:`Manage --> Share`.

The recipient receives an email saying that he has been invited to access a document. In the example
below, a project was shared. When the user opens it, he sees the settings of that project and can
access its tasks, for example.
