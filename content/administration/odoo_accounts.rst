Odoo.com account
================

Open the `Connection & Security page <https://www.odoo.com/my/security>`_ on your Odoo.com account
portal to:

- Change your :guilabel:`Password`.

  .. note::
     - When you create a database, a user linked to your Odoo.com account is generated on the
       database. Changing your Odoo.com account's password will also modify the password used to
       sign in with that user to the database.
     - You can set a database-specific password for that user by going to the :ref:`database's
       settings <users/change-password>`. However, you will still be able to sign in with your
       Odoo.com account's password.

- Enable :guilabel:`Two-factor authentication` using an authenticator app.

  .. seealso::
     Refer to the :doc:`Two-factor authentication documentation <../applications/general/users/2fa>`
     for more information. The process to enable it for a database user and for your Odoo.com
     account is similar.

- :guilabel:`Log out from all devices` signed in to your Odoo.com account, except for the current
  session.

   .. tip::
      To log out from the current session, click the :icon:`fa-user-circle-o` (:guilabel:`user`)
      icon in the top right and select :icon:`fa-sign-out` :guilabel:`Logout`.

- Enable :ref:`developer mode <developer-mode>` to add a :ref:`developer API key
  <api/external_api/keys>`.

- :guilabel:`Delete` your account.

  .. danger::
     Deleting your Odoo.com account is **irreversible**. Once deleted, your account **cannot be
     retrieved**.

Open the `Account Information page <https://www.odoo.com/my/account>`_ to edit your account details,
including your **email address**.

.. note::
   - When you create a database, a user linked to your Odoo.com account is generated on the
     database. Changing your Odoo.com account's email address does not modify the email address used
     to sign in with that user.
   - You can set a database-specific email address for that user by clicking your avatar in the
     top-right corner of the database and selecting :guilabel:`My Preferences`. You will still need
     to sign in to the database using the email address used at the time of the database creation.
   - To change the email address used to sign in to a database, `contact Odoo Support
     <https://www.odoo.com/help>`_.

.. tip::
   In addition to the database you create, all databases you are :ref:`invited to join
   <users/add-individual>` with your Odoo.com account's email address will be displayed under the
   `database manager <https://www.odoo.com/my/databases>`_.
