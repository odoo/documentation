Documents
=========

**Odoo Documents** allows you to store, view and manage files within Odoo.

You can upload any type of file (max 64MB per file on Odoo Online/SaaS), and organize them in
various workspaces.

Workflow actions
================

Workflow actions are automated actions you can create and customize at the level of each
workspace. They appear next to a file whenever it meets the criteria you set. That way you can,
for example, add tags to a file or move it to another workspace with a single click. Workflow
actions help you streamline the management of your documents and your overall business operations.

Create workflow actions
-----------------------

To create workflow actions, go to :menuselection:`Documents --> Configuration --> Workspaces` and
select the workspace where the action should apply. Click on the *Actions* smart button, and then
on *Create*.

.. note::
   An action applies to all *Child Workspaces* under the *Parent Workspace* you selected.

.. tip::
   If you use the :doc:`developer mode <../general/developer_mode/activate>`, you can directly
   access all your actions by going to :menuselection:`Documents --> Configuration --> Actions`.

Set the conditions
------------------

After naming your workflow action, you can set the conditions that trigger the appearance of the
action button on the right-side panel when selecting a file.

There are three basic types of conditions you can set:

#. **Tags**: you can both use the *Contains* and *Does not contain* conditions, meaning the files
   *must have* or *mustn't have* the tags set here.

#. **Contact**: the files must be associated with the contact set here.

#. **Owner**: the files must be associated with the owner set here.

.. tip::
   If you don't set any conditions, the action button appears for all files located inside the
   selected workspace.

Advanced condition type: domain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::
   It is recommended to have some knowledge of Odoo development to properly configure *Domain*
   filters.

To access the *Domain* condition, the :doc:`developer mode <../general/developer_mode/activate>`
needs to be activated. Once that's done, select the *Domain* condition type, and click on *Add
Filter*.

To create a rule, you typically select a field, an operator, and a value. For example, if you want
to add a workflow action to all the PDF files inside a workspace, set the field to *Mime Type*, the
operator to *contains*, and the value to *pdf*.

Click on *Add node* (plus-circle icon) and *Add branch* (ellipsis icon) to add conditions and
sub-conditions. You can then specify if your rule should match *ALL* or *ANY* conditions. You can
also edit the rule directly using the *Code editor*.
