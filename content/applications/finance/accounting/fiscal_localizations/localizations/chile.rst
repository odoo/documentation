Introduction
============

The Chilean localization has been improved and extended in Odoo v13. In this version, the next 
modules are available:

- **l10n_cl:** Adds accounting features for the Chilean localization, which represent the minimal 
  configuration required for a company to operate in Chile and under the SII 
  (Servicio de Impuestos Internos) regulations and guidelines.
  
- **l10n_cl_edi:** Includes all technical and functional requirements to generate and receive 
  Electronic Invoice via web service, based on the SII regulations. 

- **l10n_cl_reports:** Adds the reports Propuesta F29 y  Balance Tributario (8 columnas). 

Configuration
=============

Install the Chilean localization modules
----------------------------------------

For this, go to *Apps* and search for Chile. Then click *Install* in the module **Chile 
E-invoicing**. This module has a dependency with **Chile - Accounting**. In case this last
one is not installed, Odoo installs it automatically with E-invoicing.

   :align: center
   :alt: Chilean module to install on Odoo.

.. note::
   When you install a database from scratch selecting Chile as country, Odoo will automatically
   install the base module: Chile - Accounting.
   
   
Company Settings
----------------

Once the modules are installed, the first step is to set up your company data. Additional
to the basic information, you need to add all the data and elements required for Electronic 
Invoice, the easiest way to configure it is in 
:menuselection:`Accounting --> Settings --> Chilean Localization`.

.. important::
   All the following configuration and functionality is only available in Odoo if your 
   company already passed the `Certification process <https://www.sii.cl/factura_electronica/
   factura_mercado/proceso_certificacion.htm>`_ 
   in the SII - Sistema de Facturación de Mercado, this certification enables you to 
   generate electronic invoices from your ERP and send them automatically to the SII. 
   If your company has not passed this certification yet, make sure you communicate this 
   to your Account Manager as a special process outside Odoo is required in order to complete 
   this certification.

Fiscal Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fill in the fiscal information for your company according to the SII register, follow the
instructions on each section.

.. image:: media/Chile02.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Chilean company fiscal data.
   
Electronic Invoice Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is part of the main information required to generate electronic Invoice, select your
environment and the legal information, as well as the email address to receive invoices
from your vendors and the alias you use to send invoices to your customers.

.. image:: media/Chile03.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Chilean edi environment settings.

Configure DTE Incoming email server
***********************************

In order to receive you the claim and acceptance emails from your customers, it is
crucial to define the DTE incoming email server, considering this configuration: 

.. image:: media/Chile03_2.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Incoming email server configuration for Chilean DTE.

.. tip::
   For your Go-live make sure you archive/remove from your inbox all the emails
   related to vendor bills that are not required to be processed in Odoo. 
   
Certificate
~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to generate the electronic invoice signature, a digital certificate with the extension ``.pfx``
is required, proceed to this section and load your file and password. 

.. image:: media/Chile03_3.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Digital certificate access.

.. image:: media/Chile04.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Digital certificate configuration.   

A certificate can be shared between several users. If this is the case leave the user field empty,
so all your billing users can use the same one. On the other hand,  if you need to restrict the
certificate for a particular user, just define the users in the certificate.

.. note::
   In some cases, depending on the certificate format, it is possible that the field Subject Serial
   Number is not loaded automatically. If this is the case, you can manually edit this field by
   filling it with the Certificate’s legal representative RUT.

Financial Reports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The report Propuesta F29 requires two values that need to be defined as part of the company
configuration: 

.. image:: media/Chile05.png

   :alt: Fiscal reports parameters.

Multicurrency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The official currency rate in Chile is provided by the Chilean service `mindicador.cl
<https://mindicador.cl>`_. You can find this service in the currency rate configuration, and you can
set a predefined interval for the rate updates.

.. image:: media/Chile05_2.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Currency reate service for Chile.
   
Chart of accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The chart of accounts is installed by default as part of the set of data included in
the localization module. The accounts are mapped automatically in: 

- Taxes.
- Default Account Payable.
- Default Account Receivable.
- Transfer Accounts.
- Conversion Rate.


Master Data
-----------

Partner
~~~~~~~

Identification Type and VAT
***************************

As part of the Chilean localization, the identification types defined by the SII
are now available on the Partner form. This information is essential for most transactions.

.. image:: media/Chile06.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Chilean identification types for partners.
 
TaxpayerType
************

In Chile, the document type associated with customers and vendors transactions is defined
based on the Taxpayer Type. This field should be defined in the partner form, when creating
a customer is important you make sure this value is set:

.. image:: media/Chile07.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Chilean taxpayer types for partners.   
 

Electronic Invoice Data
***********************

As part of the information that is sent in the electronic Invoice, you need to define the
email that is going to appear as the sender of the electronic invoice to your customer, and
the Industry description. 

.. image:: media/Chile07_2.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Chilean electronic invoice data for partners.
   

Taxes
~~~~~

As part of the localization module, the taxes are created automatically with their related
financial account and configuration.

.. image:: media/Chile08.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Chilean taxes list.

Taxes Types
***********

Chile has several tax types, the most common ones are:

- VAT. Is the regular VAT and it can have several rates. 
- ILA (Impuesto a la Ley de Alcholes). Taxes for alcoholic drinks. It has a different rate.


Fiscal Positions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Based on the purchase transactions, the VAT can have different affections. This will be done
in Odoo using the default purchase fiscal positions. 


Document Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some Latin American countries, including Chile, some accounting transactions like invoices and
vendor bills are classified by document types defined by the government fiscal authorities (In
Chile case: SII).

The document type is essential information that needs to be displayed in the printed reports and
that needs to be easily identified within the set of invoices as well of account moves.

Each document type can have a unique sequence per company.  As part of the localization,
the Document Type includes the country on which the document is applicable and the data
is created automatically when the localization module is installed.

The information required for the document types is included by default so the user doesn't need to
fill anything on this view:

.. image:: media/Chile09.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Chilean fiscal document types list. 

.. note::
   There are several document types that are inactive by default but can be activated if needed.


Use on Invoices
***************

The document type on each transaction will be determined by:

- The Journal related to the Invoice, identifying if the journal uses documents.
- Condition applied based on the type of Issues and Receiver (ex. Type of fiscal
  regimen of the buyer and type of fiscal regimen of the vendor).
  

Journals
--------

Usage
~~~~~

Sales
*****

Sales Journals in Odoo usually represent a business unit or location, example:

- Ventas Santiago.
- Ventas Valparaiso.

For the retail stores is common to have one journal per POS: 

- Cashier 1.
- Cashier 2.


Purchases
*********

The transactions purchase can be managed with a single journal, but sometimes companies use
more than one in order to handle some accounting transactions that are not related to vendor
bills but can be easily registered using this model, for example:

- Tax Payments to government.
- Employees payments.


Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When creating sales journals the next information must be filled in: 

**Point of sale type**: If the Sales journal will be used for electronic documents, the option
Online must be selected. Otherwise, if the journal is used for invoices imported from a previous
system or if you are using the SII portal “Facturación MiPyme“ you can use the option Manual. 

**Use Documents**: This field is used to define if the journal will use Document Types. It is only
applicable to Purchase and Sales journals that can be related to the
different sets of document types available in Chile. By default, all the sales journals created will
use documents. 
  
.. image:: media/Chile41.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Document type configuration on Journal.
   
.. important::
   For the Chilean localization, it is important to define the default Debit and Credit accounts
   as they are required for one of the debit notes use cases.
   
CAF
---

A CAF (Folio Authorization Code) is required, for each document type that is issued to your
customers, the CAF is a file the SII provides to the Emisor with the folio/sequence authorized 
for the electronic invoice documents.

Your company can make several requests for folios and obtain several CAFs, each one associated
with different ranges of folios. The CAFs are shared within all the journals, this means
that you only need one active CAF per document type and it will be applied on all journals.

Please refer to the SII documentation to check the detail on how to acquire the CAF:
`SII Timbraje <https://palena.sii.cl/dte/mn_timbraje.html>`_.

.. important::
   The CAFs required by the SII are different from Production to Test (Certification mode). Make
   sure you have the correct CAF set depending on your environment.

	
Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have the CAF files you need to associate them with a document type in Odoo,
in order to add a CAF, just follow these steps:
 
1. Access to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Settings --> CAF`
2. Upload the file.
3. Save the CAF.

.. image:: media/Chile39.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Steps to add a new CAF.

Once loaded, the status changes to *In Use*. At this moment, when a transaction is used
for this document type, the invoice number takes the first folio in the sequence. 

.. important::
   In case you have used some folios in your previous system, make sure you set the next valid
   folio when the first transaction is created. 



Usage and Testing
=================

Electronic Invoice Workflow
---------------------------

In the Chilean localization the electronic Invoice workflow covers the Emission of
Customer Invoices and the reception of Vendor Bills, in the next diagram we explain how
the information transmitted to the SII and between the customers and Vendors. 

.. image:: media/Chile14.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Diagram with Electronic invoice transactions.
   

Customer invoice Emission
-------------------------

After the partners and journals are created and configured, the invoices are created in
the standard way, for Chile one of the differentiators is the document type which is selected
automatically based on the Taxpayer. 

You can manually change the document type if needed. 

.. image:: media/Chile15.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Document type selection on invoices.
   
.. important::
   Documents type 33: Electronic Invoice must have at least one item with tax, otherwise the SII
   rejects the document validation.

Validation and DTE Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When all the invoice information is filled, either manually or automatically when it’s created
from a sales order, proceed to validate the invoice.  After the invoice is posted:

- The DTE File (Electronic Tax Document) is created automatically and added in the chatter.
- The DTE SII status is set as: Pending to be sent. 

  .. image:: media/Chile16.png
     :align: center
     :alt: DTE XML File displayed in chatter.

The DTE Status is updated automatically by Odoo with a scheduled action that runs every day
at night, if you need to get the response from the SII immediately you can do it manually as well.
The DTE status workflow is as follows: 

.. image:: media/Chile17.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Transition of DTE statuses.
   

1. In the first step the DTE is sent to the SII, you can manually send it using the button: Enviar
   Ahora, a SII Tack number is generated and assigned to the invoice, you can use this number to 
   check the details the SII sent back by email. The DTE status is updated to Ask for Status.


2. Once the SII response is received Odoo updates the DTE Status, in case you want to do it 
   manually just click on the button: Verify on SII. The result can either be Accepted, Accepted 
   With Objection or Rejected.
   
   .. image:: media/Chile18.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Identification transaction for invoice and Status update.


   There are several internal status in the SII before you get Acceptance or Rejection, in
   case you click continuously  the Button Verify in SII, you will receive in the chatter the
   detail of those intermediate statuses:
   
   .. image:: media/Chile18_2.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Descprtion of each DTE status in the chatter.

3. The final response from the SII, can take on of these values:


   **Accepted:** Indicates the invoice information is correct, our document is now fiscally valid
   and it’s automatically sent to the customer. 

   **Accepted with objections:** Indicates the invoice information is correct but a minor issue
   was identified, nevertheless our document is now fiscally valid and it’s automatically
   sent to the customer.

   .. image:: media/Chile19.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Email track once it is sent to the customer.

   **Rejected:** Indicates the information in the invoice is incorrect and needs to be
   corrected, the detail of the issue is received in the emails you registered in the
   SII, if it is properly configured in Odoo, the details are also retrieved
   in the chatter once the email server is processed.
	 
   If the invoice is Rejected please follow this steps:
	 
   * Change the document to draft.
   * Make the required corrections based on the message received from the SII.
   * Post the invoice again.

Crossed references
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the Invoice is created as a result of another fiscal document, the information related to the
originator document must be registered in the Tab Cross Reference, which is commonly used for 
credit or debit notes, but in some cases can be used on Customer Invoices as well. In the case of the
credit and debit notes, they are set automatically by Odoo:

.. image:: media/Chile21.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Invoice tab with origin document number and data.

Invoice PDF Report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the invoice is accepted and validated by the SII and the PDF is printed, it includes the
fiscal elements that indicate that the document is fiscally valid:

.. image:: media/Chile22.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Barcode and fiscal elements in the invoice report.

.. important::
   If you are hosted in Odoo SH or On-Premise, you should manually install the ``pdf417gen``
   library. Use the following command to install it: ``pip install pdf417gen``.

Commercial Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the invoice has been sent to the customer:

1. DTE partner status changes to “Sent”.
2. The customer must send a reception confirmation email.
3. Subsequently, if all the commercial terms and invoice data are correct, they will send the
   Acceptance confirmation, otherwise they send a Claim.
4. The field DTE acceptation status is updated automatically.

.. image:: media/Chile23.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Message with the commercial acceptance from the customer.
   

Processed for Claimed invoices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the invoice has been Accepted by the SII **it can not be cancelled in Odoo**.  In case you
get a Claim for your customer the correct way to proceed is with a Credit Note to either cancel
the Invoice or correct it. Please refer to the Credit Notes section for more details. 

.. image:: media/Chile24.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Invoice Comercial status updated to Claimed.

Common Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are multiple reasons behind a rejection from the SII, but these are some of the common errors
you might have and which is the related solution. 

- Error: ``RECHAZO- DTE Sin Comuna Origen.``
  
  *Hint:* Make sure the Company Address is properly filled including the State and City. 

- Error en Monto: ``- IVA debe declararse.``
  
  *Hint:* The invoice lines should include one VAT tax, make sure you add one on each invoice line. 

- Error: ``Rut No Autorizado a Firmar.``
  
  *Hint:* The invoice lines should include one VAT tax, make sure you add one on each invoice line. 

- Error: ``Fecha/Número Resolucion Invalido RECHAZO- CAF Vencido : (Firma_DTE[AAAA-MM-DD] -
  CAF[AAAA-MM-DD]) &gt; 6 meses.``
  
  *Hint:* Try to add a new CAF related to this document as the one you’re using is expired.
  
- Error: ``Element '{http://www.sii.cl/SiiDte%7DRutReceptor': This element is not expected. Expected
  is ( {http://www.sii.cl/SiiDte%7DRutEnvia ).``
  
  *Hint:* Make sure the field Document Type and VAT are set either in the Customer and in the main
  company.
   
- GLOSA: ``Usuario sin permiso de envio.``
  
  *Hint:* This error indicates that most likely, your company has not passed the `Certification
  process <https://www.sii.cl/factura_electronica/factura_mercado/proceso_certificacion.htm>`_ in 
  the SII - Sistema de Facturación de Mercado. If this is the case, please contact your Account 
  Manager or Customer Support as this certification is not part of the the Odoo services,
  but we can give you some alternatives.



Credit Notes
------------

When a cancellation or correction is needed over a validated invoice, a credit note must be
generated. It is important to consider that a CAF file is required for the Credit Note,
which is identified as document 64 in the SII.  

.. image:: media/Chile40.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Creation of CAF for Credit notes.


.. tip:: Refer to the CAF section where we described the process to load the CAF on each 
   document type.

Use Cases

   :alt: Credit note for partial refund to correct amounts, using the SII reference code 3.

Debit Notes
-----------

As part of the Chilean localization, besides creating credit notes from an existing document you
can also create debit Notes. For this just use the button “Add Debit Note”.  The two main use
cases for debit notes are detailed below. 

Use Cases
~~~~~~~~~

Add debt on Invoices
********************

The most common use case for debit notes is to increase the value of an existing invoice, you
need to select option 3 in the field Reference code SII:

.. image:: media/Chile31.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Debit note for partial refund to crrect amounts, using the SII reference code 3.

Documentos de referencia.*

.. image:: media/Chile33.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Creating a debit note to cancel a credit note with the SII code reference 1.


Vendor Bills
------------

As part of the Chilean localization, you can configure your Incoming email server as the same you
have register in the SII in order to:

- Automatically receive the vendor bills DTE and create the vendor bill based on this information. 
- Automatically Send the reception acknowledgement to your vendor. 
- Accept or Claim the document and send this status to your vendor. 


Reception
~~~~~~~~~

As soon as the vendor email with the attached DTE is received:
1. The vendor Bill mapping all the information included in the xml.
2. An email is sent to the vendor with the Reception acknowledgement. 
3. The DTE status is set as:  Acuse de Recibido Enviado

.. image:: media/Chile34.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Messages recorded in the chatter with the reception notification for the vendor. 

Acceptation
~~~~~~~~~~~

If all the commercial information is correct on your vendor bill, you can accept the document using
the button: Aceptar Documento, once this is done the DTE Acceptation Status  changes to: Accepted and
an email of acceptance is sent to the vendor. 

.. image:: media/Chile35.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Acceptance button in vendor bills to inform the vendor all the document is comercially accepted.
   

Claim
~~~~~

In case there is a commercial issue or the information is not correct on your vendor bill, you can
Claim the document before validating it,  using the button: Claim, once this is done the DTE
Acceptation Status  change to: Claim  and an email of acceptance is sent to the vendor. 

.. image:: media/Chile36.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Claim button in vendor bills to inform the vendor all the document is comercially rejected.
   
If you claim a vendor bill, the status changes from draft to cancel automatically. Considering this
as best practice, all the Claim documents should be canceled as they won’t be valid for your
accounting records. 


Financial Reports
=================

Balance Tributario de 8 Columnas
--------------------------------

This report presents the accounts in detail (with their respective balances), classifying them
according to their origin and determining the level of profit or loss that the business had within
the evaluated period of time, so that a real and complete knowledge of the status of a company. 

You can find this report in :menuselection:`Accounting --> Accounting --> Reports`

Propuesta F29
-------------

The form F29 is a new system that the SII enabled to taxpayers, and that replaces the Purchase and
Sales Books. This report is integrated by Purchase Register (CR) and the Sales Register (RV).
Its purpose is to support the transactions related to VAT, improving its control and declaration. 

This record is supplied by the electronic tax documents (DTE’s) that have been received by the
SII.

You can find this report in :menuselection:`Accounting --> Accounting --> Reports`
