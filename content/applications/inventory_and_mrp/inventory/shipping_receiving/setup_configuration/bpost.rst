Bpost integration
=================

Set up the *Bpost* shipping connector in Odoo to manage Bpost shipments to clients directly within
Odoo. To configure it, complete these steps:

#. Create a Bpost account.
#. Get the :ref:`Account ID and passphrase <inventory/shipping/Bpost-account>`.
#. Set up the shipping method in Odoo.

Upon completion, it is possible to calculate the cost of shipping, based on package size and weight,
have the charges applied directly to a Bpost business account, and automatically print Bpost
tracking labels through Odoo.

Bpost account setup
===================

To begin, go to the `Bpost website <https://parcel.bpost.be/en/home/business>`_ to create, or log
into, the company's Bpost business account. When creating the Bpost account, have the company's VAT
number and mobile phone number ready.

Follow the website's steps to complete registration, and sign up for shipping services. Doing so
submits a request to enter a contractual business relationship between the company and Bpost.

.. important::
   Odoo **cannot** be integrated with `non-business Bpost
   <https://bpost.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/174847-account-id-and-passphrase>`_
   accounts.

After completing the setup, get the Bpost account ID and passphrase, by navigating to the
:guilabel:`Shipping Manager` menu item.

.. _inventory/shipping/bpost-account:

On the :guilabel:`Shipping Manager` page, go to the :guilabel:`Admin` tab, then the
:guilabel:`General Settings` tab, to find the :guilabel:`Account ID` and :guilabel:`Passphrase`
needed to configure Odoo's shipping method.
