QWeb Templates
==============

QWeb is the primary templating_ engine used by Odoo\ [#othertemplates]_. It
is an XML templating engine\ [#genshif]_ and used mostly to generate HTML_
fragments and pages.

Template directives are specified as XML attributes prefixed with ``t-``,
for instance ``t-if`` for :ref:`reference/qweb/conditionals`, with elements
and other attributes being rendered directly.

To avoid element rendering, a placeholder element ``<t>`` is also available,
which executes its directive but doesn't generate any output in and of
itself::

    <t t-if="condition">
        <p>Test</p>
    </t>

will result in::

    <p>Test</p>

if ``condition`` is true, but::

    <div t-if="condition">
        <p>Test</p>
    </div>

will result in::

    <div>
        <p>Test</p>
    </div>

.. _reference/qweb/output:

Data output
===========

QWeb's output directive ``out`` will automatically HTML-escape its input,
limiting XSS_ risks when displaying user-provided content.

``out`` takes an expression, evaluates it and injects the result in the document::

    <p><t t-out="value"/></p>

rendered with the value ``value`` set to ``42`` yields::

    <p>42</p>

See :ref:`reference/qweb/advanced-output` for more advanced topics (e.g.
injecting raw HTML, etc...).

.. _reference/qweb/conditionals:

Conditionals
============

QWeb has a conditional directive ``if``, which evaluates an expression given
as attribute value::

    <div>
        <t t-if="condition">
            <p>ok</p>
        </t>
    </div>

The element is rendered if the condition is true::

    <div>
        <p>ok</p>
    </div>

but if the condition is false it is removed from the result::

    <div>
    </div>

The conditional rendering applies to the bearer of the directive, which does
not have to be ``<t>``::

    <div>
        <p t-if="condition">ok</p>
    </div>

will give the same results as the previous example.

Extra conditional branching directives ``t-elif`` and ``t-else`` are also
available::

    <div>
        <p t-if="user.birthday == today()">Happy birthday!</p>
        <p t-elif="user.login == 'root'">Welcome master!</p>
        <p t-else="">Welcome!</p>
    </div>


.. _reference/qweb/loops:

Loops
=====

QWeb has an iteration directive ``foreach`` which take an expression returning
the collection to iterate on, and a second parameter ``t-as`` providing the
name to use for the "current item" of the iteration::

    <t t-foreach="[1, 2, 3]" t-as="i">
        <p><t t-out="i"/></p>
    </t>

will be rendered as::

    <p>1</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>3</p>

Like conditions, ``foreach`` applies to the element bearing the directive's
attribute, and

::

    <p t-foreach="[1, 2, 3]" t-as="i">
        <t t-out="i"/>
    </p>

is equivalent to the previous example.

``foreach`` can iterate on an array (the current item will be the current
value) or a mapping (the current item will be the current key). Iterating on an
integer (equivalent to iterating on an array between 0 inclusive and the
provided integer exclusive) is still supported but deprecated.

In addition to the name passed via ``t-as``, ``foreach`` provides a few other
variables for various data points:

.. warning:: ``$as`` will be replaced by the name passed to ``t-as``

.. rst-class:: o-definition-list

:samp:`{$as}_all` (deprecated)
    the object being iterated over

    .. note:: This variable is only available on JavaScript QWeb, not Python.

:samp:`{$as}_value`
    the current iteration value, identical to ``$as`` for lists and integers,
    but for mappings it provides the value (where ``$as`` provides the key)
:samp:`{$as}_index`
    the current iteration index (the first item of the iteration has index 0)
:samp:`{$as}_size`
    the size of the collection if it is available
:samp:`{$as}_first`
    whether the current item is the first of the iteration (equivalent to
    :samp:`{$as}_index == 0`)
:samp:`{$as}_last`
    whether the current item is the last of the iteration (equivalent to
    :samp:`{$as}_index + 1 == {$as}_size`), requires the iteratee's size be
    available
:samp:`{$as}_parity` (deprecated)
    either ``"even"`` or ``"odd"``, the parity of the current iteration round
:samp:`{$as}_even` (deprecated)
    a boolean flag indicating that the current iteration round is on an even
    index
:samp:`{$as}_odd` (deprecated)
    a boolean flag indicating that the current iteration round is on an odd
    index

These extra variables provided and all new variables created into the
``foreach`` are only available in the scope of the ``foreach``. If the
variable exists outside the context of the ``foreach``, the value is copied
at the end of the foreach into the global context.

::

    <t t-set="existing_variable" t-value="False"/>
    <!-- existing_variable now False -->

    <p t-foreach="[1, 2, 3]" t-as="i">
        <t t-set="existing_variable" t-value="True"/>
        <t t-set="new_variable" t-value="True"/>
        <!-- existing_variable and new_variable now True -->
    </p>

    <!-- existing_variable always True -->
    <!-- new_variable undefined -->

.. _reference/qweb/attributes:

attributes
==========

QWeb can compute attributes on-the-fly and set the result of the computation
on the output node. This is done via the ``t-att`` (attribute) directive which
exists in 3 different forms:

.. rst-class:: o-definition-list

:samp:`t-att-{$name}`
    an attribute called ``$name`` is created, the attribute value is evaluated
    and the result is set as the attribute's value::

        <div t-att-a="42"/>

    will be rendered as::

        <div a="42"></div>
:samp:`t-attf-{$name}`
    same as previous, but the parameter is a :term:`format string`
    instead of just an expression, often useful to mix literal and non-literal
    string (e.g. classes)::

        <t t-foreach="[1, 2, 3]" t-as="item">
            <li t-attf-class="row {{ (item_index % 2 === 0) ? 'even' : 'odd' }}">
                <t t-out="item"/>
            </li>
        </t>

    will be rendered as::

        <li class="row even">1</li>
        <li class="row odd">2</li>
        <li class="row even">3</li>

    .. tip::
       There are two equivalent syntaxes for format strings: ``"plain_text {{code}}"`` (aka
       jinja-style) and ``"plain_text #{code}"`` (aka ruby-style).

:samp:`t-att=mapping`
    if the parameter is a mapping, each (key, value) pair generates a new
    attribute and its value::

        <div t-att="{'a': 1, 'b': 2}"/>

    will be rendered as::

        <div a="1" b="2"></div>
:samp:`t-att=pair`
    if the parameter is a pair (tuple or array of 2 element), the first
    item of the pair is the name of the attribute and the second item is the
    value::

        <div t-att="['a', 'b']"/>

    will be rendered as::

        <div a="b"></div>

.. _reference/qweb/set:

setting variables
=================

QWeb allows creating variables from within the template, to memoize a computation (to use it
multiple times), give a piece of data a clearer name, ...

This is done via the ``set`` directive, which takes the name of the variable
to create. The value to set can be provided in two ways:

* a ``t-value`` attribute containing an expression, and the result of its
  evaluation will be set::

    <t t-set="foo" t-value="2 + 1"/>
    <t t-out="foo"/>

  will print ``3``
* if there is no ``t-value`` attribute, the node's body is rendered and set
  as the variable's value::

    <t t-set="foo">
        <li>ok</li>
    </t>
    <t t-out="foo"/>

.. _reference/qweb/call:

.. _reference/qweb/sub-templates:

calling sub-templates
=====================

QWeb templates can be used for top-level rendering, but they can also be used
from within another template (to avoid duplication or give names to parts of
templates) using the ``t-call`` directive::

    <t t-call="other-template"/>

This calls the named template with the execution context of the parent, if
``other_template`` is defined as::

    <p><t t-value="var"/></p>

the call above will be rendered as ``<p/>`` (no content), but::

    <t t-set="var" t-value="1"/>
    <t t-call="other-template"/>

will be rendered as ``<p>1</p>``.

However, this has the problem of being visible from outside the ``t-call``.
Alternatively, content set in the body of the ``call`` directive will be
evaluated *before* calling the sub-template, and can alter a local context::

    <t t-call="other-template">
        <t t-set="var" t-value="1"/>
    </t>
    <!-- "var" does not exist here -->

The body of the ``call`` directive can be arbitrarily complex (not just
``set`` directives), and its rendered form will be available within the called
template as a magical ``0`` variable::

    <div>
        This template was called with content:
        <t t-out="0"/>
    </div>

being called thus::

    <t t-call="other-template">
        <em>content</em>
    </t>

will result in::

    <div>
        This template was called with content:
        <em>content</em>
    </div>

.. _reference/qweb/advanced-output:

Advanced Output
===============

By default, ``out`` should HTML-escape content which needs to be escaped,
protecting the system against XSS_

Content which does *not* need to be escaped will instead be injected as-is in
the document, and may become part of the document's actual markup.

The only cross-platform "safe" content is the output of
:ref:`t-call <reference/qweb/call>` or a :ref:`t-set <reference/qweb/set>`
used with a "body" (as opposed to ``t-value`` or ``t-valuef``).

Python
------

Usually you should not have to care too much: APIs for which it makes sense
should generate "safe" content automatically, and things should work
transparently.

For the cases where things need to be clearer though the following APIs output
safe content which will by default not be (re-)escaped when injected into
templates:

* :class:`HTML fields <odoo.fields.Html>`.
* :func:`~odoo.tools.misc.html_escape` and :func:`markupsafe.escape` (they are
  aliases, and have no risk of double-escaping).
* :func:`~odoo.tools.mail.html_sanitize`.
* :class:`markupsafe.Markup`.

  .. warning:: :class:`markupsafe.Markup` is an unsafe API, it's an *assertion*
               that you want the content to be markup-safe but necessarily can
               not check that, it should be used with care.
* :func:`~odoo.tools.pycompat.to_text` does not mark the content as safe, but
  will not strip that information from safe content.

Creating safe content using :class:`~markupsafe.Markup`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See the official documentation for explanations, but the big advantage of
:class:`~markupsafe.Markup` is that it's a very rich type overrinding
:class:`str` operations to *automatically escape parameters*.

This means that it's easy to create *safe* html snippets by using
:class:`~markupsafe.Markup` on a string literal and "formatting in"
user-provided (and thus potentially unsafe) content:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> Markup('<em>Hello</em> ') + '<foo>'
    Markup('<em>Hello</em> &lt;foo&gt;')
    >>> Markup('<em>Hello</em> %s') % '<foo>'
    Markup('<em>Hello</em> &lt;foo&gt;')

though it is a very good thing, note that the effects can be odd at times:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> Markup('<a>').replace('>', 'x')
    Markup('<a>')
    >>> Markup('<a>').replace(Markup('>'), 'x')
    Markup('<ax')
    >>> Markup('<a&gt;').replace('>', 'x')
    Markup('<ax')
    >>> Markup('<a&gt;').replace('>', '&')
    Markup('<a&amp;')

.. tip:: Most of the content-safe APIs actually return a
         :class:`~markupsafe.Markup` with all that implies.

Javascript
----------

.. todo:: what APIs do we end up considering OK there?
.. todo:: talk about vdom thingies?

.. warning::

    Due to the lack of operator overriding, :js:class:`Markup` is a much more
    limited type than :class:`~markupsafe.Markup`.

    Therefore it doesn't override methods either, and any operation involving
    :js:class:`Markup` will return a normal :js:class:`String` (and in reality
    not even that, but a "primitive string").

    This means the fallback is safe, but it is easy to trigger double-escaping
    when working with :js:class:`Markup` objects.

>>>>>>> 3ced06af7 (temp)
forcing double-escaping
-----------------------

If content is marked as safe but for some reason needs to be escaped anyway
(e.g. printing the markup of an HTML fields), it can just be converted back
to a normal string to "strip" the safety flag e.g. `str(content)` in Python and
`String(content)` in Javascript.

.. note::

    Because :class:`~markupsafe.Markup` is a much richer type than
    :js:class:`Markup`, some operations will strip the safety information from
    a :js:class:`Markup` but not a :class:`~markupsafe.Markup` e.g. string
    concatenation (``'' + content``) in Python will result in a
    :class:`~markupsafe.Markup` with the other operand having been properly
    escaped, while in Javascript will yield a :js:class:`String` where the
    other operand was *not* escaped before the concatenation.

Deprecated output directives
----------------------------

.. rst-class:: o-definition-list

``esc``
    An alias for ``out``, would originally HTML-escape its input. Not yet
    formally deprecated as the only difference between ``out`` and ``esc`` is
    that the latter is a bit unclear / incorrect.
``raw``
    A version of ``out`` which *never* escapes its content. Content is emitted
    as-is, whether it's safe or not.

    .. deprecated:: 15.0

        Use ``out`` with a :class:`markupsafe.Markup` value instead.

        ``t-raw`` was deprecated because as the code *producting* the content
        evolves it can be hard to track that it's going to be used for markup,
        leading to more complicated reviews and more dangerous lapses.

Python
======

Exclusive directives
--------------------

Asset bundles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. todo:: have fme write these up because I've no idea how they work

"smart records" fields formatting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``t-field`` directive can only be used when performing field access
(``a.b``) on a "smart" record (result of the ``browse`` method). It is able
to automatically format based on field type, and is integrated in the
website's rich text editing.

``t-options`` can be used to customize fields, the most common option
is ``widget``, other options are field- or widget-dependent.

Debugging
---------

.. rst-class:: o-definition-list

``t-debug``
    invokes a debugger using PDB's ``set_trace`` API. The parameter should
    be the name of a module, on which a ``set_trace`` method is called::

        <t t-debug="pdb"/>

    is equivalent to ``importlib.import_module("pdb").set_trace()``

Rendering cache:
----------------

``t-cache="key_cache"`` tags part of template to be cached at rendering time.
Every sub-directives will be call only during the first rendering. It means
that the sql queries excecuted during the rendering of those sub-directives
are also done only once.

``t-nocache="documentation"`` tags part of template to be render every time.
The content can only use the root values.

Why and when to use ``t-cache``?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This directive is used to speed up the rendering, by caching parts of the final
document, which may save queries to the database.  However, it should be used
sparingly, as ``t-cache`` will inevitably complicate templates (and their
understanding of ``t-set`` for example).

However, in order to actually save database queries, it might be necessary to
render the template with values that are evaluated lazily.  If those lazy
values are used in a cached part, they will not be evaluated if the part is
available in cache.

The ``t-cache`` directive is useful for template parts using values that depend
on a limited amount of data.  We recommend to analyze the rendering of the
template with the profiler (by activating the "**Add qweb directive context**"
option).  Passing lazy values to the rendering in controllers allow you to
display the directives using these values and triggering the queries.

A concern of using such a cache are making it available to different users
(different users should render the cached parts the same way).  Another
potential issue is to invalidate its entries when necessary.  For the latter,
the **key expression** should be chosen wisely.  Using the ``write_date`` of a
recordset can make a cache key out-of-date without having to discard it
explicitly from the cache, for instance.

One should also pay attention to the fact that the values in ``t-cache`` parts
are scoped. This implies that if there are ``t-set`` directives in this part of
the template, the rendering of what comes after it could be different than if
there was no ``t-cache`` directive.

What if there is a ``t-cache`` inside a ``t-cache``?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The parts are cached. Each containing only the string corresponding to its
rendering. Thus, the ``t-cache`` inside will probably be read less often, its
cache key will not necessarily be used. If this must be the case, then you may
need to add a ``t-nocache`` (on the same node or a parent).

What is ``t-nocache`` used for?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to cache part of a template with ``t-cache`` but a small piece must
remain dynamic and be evaluated at cache times. However, the part in
``t-nocache`` will not have access to the ``t-set`` value of the template. Only
the values ​​provided by the controller are accessible there.
For example, the menu is cached because it's the same all the time and takes
time to render (using the performance devtools with the qweb context lets you
investigate). However, in the menu, we want the ecommerce cart to be always up
to date. So there is a ``t-nocache`` to keep this part dynamic.

The base of ``t-cache``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``t-cache`` directive allows you to store the rendered result of a template.
The **key expression** (eg 42: ``t-cache="42"``) will be evaluated as a python
expression. This will be used to generate the **cache key**. So there can be
different **cache values** (cached render part) for the same template part. If
the **key expression** is a tuple or a list, it will be searched when generating
the **cache key**. If one or more recordsets are returned by the **key
expression**, then the model, ids and their corresponding write_date will be
used to generate the **cache key**. Special case: If the **key expression**
returns a Falsy value, then the content will not be cached.

Example::

    <div t-cache="record,bool(condition)">
        <span t-if="condition" t-field="record.partner_id.name">
        <span t-else="" t-field="record.partner_id" t-options-widget="contact">
    </div>

In this case, there may be values ​​(string) in the cache corresponding to each
record already returned with a true condition, as well as for the false
condition. And if a module modifies the record, the write_date being modified,
the cached value is discarded.

``t-cache`` and scoped values (``t-set``, ``t-foreach``...)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Values in ``t-cache`` are scoped, this involves a change in behavior between
having or not having ``t-cache`` on one of the parent nodes. Don't forget to
take into account that Odoo uses a lot of templates, ``t-call`` and view
inheritance. Adding a ``t-cache`` can therefore modify the rendering of a
template that you do not see when editing.
(``t-foreach`` it's like a ``t-set`` for each iteration)

Example::

        <div>
            <t t-set="a" t-value="1"/>
            <inside>
                <t t-set="a" t-value="2"/>
                <t t-out="a"/>
            </inside>
            <outside t-out="a"/>

            <t t-set="b" t-value="1"/>
            <inside t-cache="True">
                <t t-set="b" t-value="2"/>
                <t t-out="b"/>
            </inside>
            <outside t-out="b"/>
        </div>

Will render::

        <div>
            <inside>2</inside>
            <outside>2</inside>

            <inside>2</inside>
            <outside>1</inside>
        </div>


The base of ``t-nocache``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The template part contained in a node with a ``t-nocache`` attribute is not
cached. This content is therefore **dynamic** and is rendered systematically.
However the available values are those provided by the controller (when
calling the ``_render`` method).

Example::

        <section>
            <article t-cache="record">
                <title><t t-out="record.name"/> <i t-nocache="">(views: <t t-out="counter"/>)</i></titlle>
                <content t-out="record.description"/>
            </article>
        </section>

Will render (counter = 1)::

        <section>
            <article>
                <title>The record name <i>(views: 1)</i></titlle>
                <content>Record description</content>
            </article>
        </section>

Here the ``<i>`` tag that contains the container will always be rendered. While
the rest is as a single string in the cache.

``t-nocache`` and scoped root values (``t-set``, ``t-foreach``...)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The contents of the ``t-nocache`` tag can be used for documentation and to
explain why the directive is added.
The values are scoped into ``t-nocache``, these values are root values only
(values provided by the controller and/or when calling the ``_render`` method
of ``ir.qweb``). ``t-set`` can be done in the template part, but will not be
available elsewhere.

Example::

        <section>
            <t t-set="counter" t-value="counter * 10"/>
            <header t-nocache="">
                <t t-set="counter" t-value="counter + 5"/>
                (views: <t t-out="counter"/>)
            </header>
            <article t-cache="record">
                <title><t t-out="record.name"/> <i t-nocache="">(views: <t t-out="counter"/>)</i></titlle>
                <content t-out="record.description"/>
            </article>
            <footer>(views: <t t-out="counter"/>)</footer>
        </section>

Will render (counter = 1)::

        <section>

Here the ``<i>`` tag that contains the container will always be rendered. While
the rest is as a single string in the cache. The counter is not updated by the
``t-set`` out of the ``t-nocache``

``t-nocache-*`` add some primitive values in the cache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to be able to use values generated in the template, it is possible to
cache them. The directive is used as ``t-nocache-*="expr"`` where ``*`` is the
name of the chosen value and ``expr`` the python expression so the result will
be cached. The cached value must be primitive type.

Example::

        <section t-cache="records">
            <article t-foreach="records" t-as="record">
                <header>
                    <title t-field="record.get_method_title()"/>
                </header>
                <footer t-nocache="This part has a dynamic counter and must be rendered all the time."
                        t-nocache-cached_value="record.get_base_counter()">
                    <span t-out="counter + cached_value"/>
                </footer>
            </article>
        </section>

The value ``cached_value`` is cached with the cached template part of
``t-cache="records"`` and add to the scoped root values each time.

Helpers
-------

Request-based
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most Python-side uses of QWeb are in controllers (and during HTTP requests),
in which case templates stored in the database (as
:ref:`views <reference/views/qweb>`) can be trivially rendered by calling
:meth:`odoo.http.HttpRequest.render`:

.. code-block:: python

    response = http.request.render('my-template', {
        'context_value': 42
    })

This automatically creates a :class:`~odoo.http.Response` object which can
be returned from the controller (or further customized to suit).

View-based
~~~~~~~~~~

At a deeper level than the previous helper is the ``_render`` method on
``ir.qweb`` (use the datable) and the public module method ``render``
(don't use the database):

.. py:method:: _render(id[, values])

    Renders a QWeb view/template by database id or :term:`external id`.
    Templates are automatically loaded from ``ir.qweb`` records.

    ``_prepare_environment`` method sets up a number of default values in
    the rendering context. The ``http_routing`` and ``website`` addons,
    also default values they need.
    You can use ``minimal_qcontext=False`` option to avoid this default
    value like the public method ``render``:

    .. rst-class:: o-definition-list

    ``request``
        the current :class:`~odoo.http.Request` object, if any
    ``debug``
        whether the current request (if any) is in ``debug`` mode
    :func:`quote_plus <werkzeug.urls.url_quote_plus>`
        url-encoding utility function
    :mod:`json`
        the corresponding standard library module
    :mod:`time`
        the corresponding standard library module
    :mod:`datetime`
        the corresponding standard library module
    `relativedelta <https://labix.org/python-dateutil#head-ba5ffd4df8111d1b83fc194b97ebecf837add454>`_
        see module
    ``keep_query``
        the ``keep_query`` helper function

    :param values: context values to pass to QWeb for rendering
    :param str engine: name of the Odoo model to use for rendering, can be
                       used to expand or customize QWeb locally (by creating
                       a "new" qweb based on ``ir.qweb`` with alterations)

.. py:method:: render(template_name, values, load, **options)

    :func:`load(ref)`
        returns etree object, ref

.. _reference/qweb/javascript:

.. todo:: the members below are no longer relevant, section to rewrite

.. API

.. It is also possible to use the ``ir.qweb`` model directly (and extend it, and
.. inherit from it):

.. .. automodule:: odoo.addons.base.ir.ir_qweb
..     :members: QWeb, QWebContext, FieldConverter, QwebWidget

Javascript
==========

Exclusive directives
--------------------

Defining templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``t-name`` directive can only be placed at the top-level of a template
file (direct children to the document root)::

    <templates>
        <t t-name="template-name">
            <!-- template code -->
        </t>
    </templates>

It takes no other parameter, but can be used with a ``<t>`` element or any
other. With a ``<t>`` element, the ``<t>`` should have a single child.

The template name is an arbitrary string, although when multiple templates
are related (e.g. called sub-templates) it is customary to use dot-separated
names to indicate hierarchical relationships.

.. _reference/qweb/template_inheritance:

Template inheritance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Template inheritance is used to either:
 - Alter existing templates in-place, e.g. to add information to templates
created by other modules.
 - Create a new template from a given parent template

Template inheritance is performed via the use of two directives:
 - ``t-inherit`` which is the name of the template to inherit from,
 - ``t-inherit-mode`` which is the behaviour of the inheritance: it can either be
   set to ``primary`` to create a new child template from the parented one or
   to ``extension`` to alter the parent template in place.

An optional ``t-name`` directive can also be specified. It will be the name of
the newly created template if used in primary mode, else it will be added as a
comment on the transformed template to help retrace inheritances.

For the inheritance itself, the changes are done using xpaths directives.
See the XPATH_ documentation for the complete set of available instructions.

Primary inheritance (child template)::

    <t t-name="child.template" t-inherit="base.template" t-inherit-mode="primary">
        <xpath expr="//ul" position="inside">
            <li>new element</li>
        </xpath>
    </t>

Extension inheritance (in-place transformation)::

    <t t-inherit="base.template" t-inherit-mode="extension">
        <xpath expr="//tr[1]" position="after">
            <tr><td>new cell</td></tr>
        </xpath>
    </t>

Old inheritance mechanism (deprecated)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Template inheritance is performed via the ``t-extend`` directive which takes
the name of the template to alter as parameter.

The directive ``t-extend`` will act as a primary inheritance when combined with
``t-name`` and as an extension one when used alone.

In both cases the alteration is then performed with any number of ``t-jquery``
sub-directives::

    <t t-extend="base.template">
        <t t-jquery="ul" t-operation="append">
            <li>new element</li>
        </t>
    </t>

The ``t-jquery`` directives takes a `CSS selector`_. This selector is used
on the extended template to select *context nodes* to which the specified
``t-operation`` is applied:

.. rst-class:: o-definition-list

``append``
    the node's body is appended at the end of the context node (after the
    context node's last child)
``prepend``
    the node's body is prepended to the context node (inserted before the
    context node's first child)
``before``
    the node's body is inserted right before the context node
``after``
    the node's body is inserted right after the context node
``inner``
    the node's body replaces the context node's children
``replace``
    the node's body is used to replace the context node itself
``attributes``
    the nodes's body should be any number of ``attribute`` elements,
    each with a ``name`` attribute and some textual content, the named
    attribute of the context node will be set to the specified value
    (either replaced if it already existed or added if not)
No operation
    if no ``t-operation`` is specified, the template body is interpreted as
    javascript code and executed with the context node as ``this``

    .. warning:: while much more powerful than other operations, this mode is
                 also much harder to debug and maintain, it is recommended to
                 avoid it

debugging
---------

The javascript QWeb implementation provides a few debugging hooks:

.. rst-class:: o-definition-list

``t-log``
    takes an expression parameter, evaluates the expression during rendering
    and logs its result with ``console.log``::

        <t t-set="foo" t-value="42"/>
        <t t-log="foo"/>

    will print ``42`` to the console
``t-debug``
    triggers a debugger breakpoint during template rendering::

        <t t-if="a_test">
            <t t-debug=""/>
        </t>

    will stop execution if debugging is active (exact condition depend on the
    browser and its development tools)
``t-js``
    the node's body is javascript code executed during template rendering.
    Takes a ``context`` parameter, which is the name under which the rendering
    context will be available in the ``t-js``'s body::

        <t t-set="foo" t-value="42"/>
        <t t-js="ctx">
            console.log("Foo is", ctx.foo);
        </t>

Helpers

.. js:attribute:: core.qweb

    (core is the ``web.core`` module) An instance of :js:class:`QWeb2.Engine` with all module-defined template
    files loaded, and references to standard helper objects ``_``
    (underscore), ``_t`` (translation function) and JSON_.

    :js:func:`core.qweb.render <QWeb2.Engine.render>` can be used to
    easily render basic module templates

.. _reference/qweb/api:

API
---

.. js:class:: QWeb2.Engine

    The QWeb "renderer", handles most of QWeb's logic (loading,
    parsing, compiling and rendering templates).

    Odoo Web instantiates one for the user in the core module, and
    exports it to ``core.qweb``. It also loads all the template files
    of the various modules into that QWeb instance.

    A :js:class:`QWeb2.Engine` also serves as a "template namespace".

    .. js:function:: QWeb2.Engine.render(template[, context])

        Renders a previously loaded template to a String, using
        ``context`` (if provided) to find the variables accessed
        during template rendering (e.g. strings to display).

        :param String template: the name of the template to render
        :param Object context: the basic namespace to use for template
                               rendering
        :returns: String

    The engine exposes an other method which may be useful in some
    cases (e.g. if you need a separate template namespace with, in
    Odoo Web, Kanban views get their own :js:class:`QWeb2.Engine`
    instance so their templates don't collide with more general
    "module" templates):

    .. js:function:: QWeb2.Engine.add_template(templates)

        Loads a template file (a collection of templates) in the QWeb
        instance. The templates can be specified as:

        An XML string
            QWeb will attempt to parse it to an XML document then load
            it.

        A URL
            QWeb will attempt to download the URL content, then load
            the resulting XML string.

        A ``Document`` or ``Node``
            QWeb will traverse the first level of the document (the
            child nodes of the provided root) and load any named
            template or template override.

        :type templates: String | Document | Node

    A :js:class:`QWeb2.Engine` also exposes various attributes for
    behavior customization:

    .. js:attribute:: QWeb2.Engine.prefix

        Prefix used to recognize directives during parsing. A string. By
        default, ``t``.

    .. js:attribute:: QWeb2.Engine.debug

        Boolean flag putting the engine in "debug mode". Normally,
        QWeb intercepts any error raised during template execution. In
        debug mode, it leaves all exceptions go through without
        intercepting them.

    .. js:attribute:: QWeb2.Engine.jQuery

        The jQuery instance used during template inheritance processing.
        Defaults to ``window.jQuery``.

    .. js:attribute:: QWeb2.Engine.preprocess_node

        A ``Function``. If present, called before compiling each DOM
        node to template code. In Odoo Web, this is used to
        automatically translate text content and some attributes in
        templates. Defaults to ``null``.

.. [#genshif] it is similar in that to Genshi_, although it does not use (and
              has no support for) `XML namespaces`_

.. [#othertemplates] although it uses a few others, either for historical
                     reasons or because they remain better fits for the
                     use case. Odoo 9.0 still depends on Jinja_ and Mako_.
