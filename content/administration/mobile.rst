Two kind of Odoo mobile app exist: the progressive web app (PWA) and store apps. Using the PWA is
recommended.

Progressive web app (PWA)
=========================

PWAs are web-based applications designed to function across different devices and platforms,
leveraging web browsers to deliver user experiences similar to native apps.

The Odoo PWA features include:

- Quick access by adding the PWA to a device's home screen
- Seamless and borderless navigation experience
- Push notifications
- SSO authentication

To install the Odoo PWA, launch a browser supporting PWAs, and sign in to an Odoo database. The
instructions to install a PWA depend on the platform and browser used.

   .. tab:: Android

      **Chrome**: open Chrome's menu (:guilabel:`⋮`), select :guilabel:`Install app`, and tap
      :guilabel:`Install`.

      **Firefox**: open Firefox's menu (:guilabel:`⋮`), select :guilabel:`Install`, and either touch
      and hold the Odoo icon or tap :guilabel:`Add automatically`.
