Odoo electronic invoicing in Slovenia
=====================================

Odoo Invoicing is your trusted partner for safe, efficient, and legally compliant e-invoicing
solutions tailored to Slovenia's regulatory standards.

Legal framework for e-invoicing in Slovenia
===========================================

In Slovenia, e-invoicing is regulated under the `Slovenian VAT Act <https://www.uradni-list.si/glasilo-uradni-list-rs/vsebina/2019-01-2291?sop=2019-01-2291>`_
and complies with `EU Directive 2014/55/EU <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014L0055>`_,
mandating the use of e-invoices for :abbr:`B2G (business-to-government)` transactions. Suppliers to
public sector entities must submit e-invoices in the e-SLOG XML format, which is the national
standard for e-invoicing. These invoices are transmitted via the UJP (Uprava Republike Slovenije
za javna plačila - Agency for Public Payments) e-invoicing platform. While B2B e-invoicing remains
optional, its adoption is encouraged to promote transparency and tax compliance.
