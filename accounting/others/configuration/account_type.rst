What is an account type ? 
==========================

An account type is a name or code given to an account that indicates the
account's purpose.

In Odoo, Account Types are used for information purpose, to generate
country-specific legal reports, set the rules to close a fiscal year and
generate opening entries.

Basically Account types categorize general account with some specific
category according to its behaviour or purpose.

How do I configure my accounts?
===============================

Account types are automatically created when installing a chart of
account. By default, Odoo provides a lot of chart of accounts, just
install the one related to your country.

It will install generic accounts. But if it does not cover all your
cases, you can create your own accounts too.

.. note::
   If you are a Saas User, your country chart of account is automatically installed.

To create a new accounts, go to the Accounting application. Open the
menu :menuselection:`Adviser --> Chart of Accounts`, the click on the
**Create** button.
