Fiscal Localization Packages
============================

**Fiscal Localization Packages** are country-specific modules that install pre-configured taxes,
fiscal positions, chart of accounts, and legal statements on your database. Some additional features,
such as the configuration of specific certificates, are also added to your Accounting app, following
your fiscal administration requirements.

.. note::
   Odoo continuously adds new localizations and improves the existing packages.

Configuration
=============

Odoo automatically installs the appropriate package for your company, according to the country
selected at the creation of the database.

.. important::
   As long as you haven't posted any entry, you can still add and select another package.

To install a new package, go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Fiscal
Localization`, click on **Install More Packages**, and install your country's module.
