Electronic invoicing (:abbr:`EDI (electronic data interchange)`)
================================================================

EDI, or electronic data interchange, is the inter-company communication of business documents, such
as purchase orders and invoices, in a standard format. Sending documents according to an EDI
standard ensures that the machine receiving the message can interpret the information correctly.
Various EDI file formats exist and are available depending on your company's country.

EDI feature enables automating the administration between companies and might also be required by
some governments for fiscal control or to facilitate the administration.

Electronic invoicing of your documents such as customer invoices, credit notes or vendor bills is
one of the application of EDI.
