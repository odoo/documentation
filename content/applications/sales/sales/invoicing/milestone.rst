Invoice project milestones
==========================

Milestone invoicing can be used for expensive or large-scale projects,
with each milestone representing a clear sequence of work that will
incrementally build up to the completion of the contract. This invoicing
method is comfortable both for the company which is ensured to get a
steady cash flow throughout the project lifetime and for the client who
can monitor the project's progress and pay in several installments.

Create milestone products
=========================

In Odoo, each milestone of your project is considered as a product. To
configure products to work this way, go to any product form.

You have to set the product type as *Service* under general
information and select *Milestones* in the sales tab.
