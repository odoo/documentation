Connecting a payment terminal allows you to offer a fluid payment flow to your customers and ease
the work of your cashiers.

.. important::
   - Ingenico payment terminals require an :doc:`IoT system </applications/general/iot>`.
   - Ingenico is currently only available in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.
   - Odoo works with the Ingenico Lane/, Desk/, and Move/ payment terminals as they support the TLV
     communication protocol through TCP/IP.

Configuration
=============

Connect an IoT system
---------------------

Connecting an Ingenico payment terminal to Odoo is a feature that requires an IoT system. For more
information on how to connect an IoT system to your database, please refer to the :doc:`IoT
documentation </applications/general/iot>`.
