Using discount tags with a barcode scanner
==========================================

If you want to sell your products with a discount, for a product getting
close to its expiration date for example, you can use discount tags.
They allow you to scan discount barcodes.

.. note::
   To use discount tags you will need to use a barcode scanner.

====================

To use discounts tags, we need to learn about barcode nomenclature.

Let's say you want to have a discount for the product with the following

Let's say you want 50% discount on a product you have to start your
barcode with 22 (for the discount barcode nomenclature) and then 50 (for
the %) before adding the product barcode. In our example, the barcode would
be:
