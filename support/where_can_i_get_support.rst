Where to find help?
===================


Odoo Enterprise
===============

Users who have a valid Odoo Enterprise subscription may always contact our support teams through our `support form <https://www.odoo.com/help>`_, no matter the hosting type you chose (Odoo Online, Odoo.sh or on your own server).

Please include in your request:

- your subscription number,
- if your database is hosted by Odoo (Odoo Online or Odoo.sh), please also send the URL of your database.

Our agents will get back to you as soon as possible.
