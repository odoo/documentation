Dus voorzien we een ramdisk voor /etc en /var (Raspbian biedt automatisch één aan voor /tp). Deze ramdisks zijn opgezet door ``setup_ramdisks.sh``, wat we uitvoeren voor alle andere init scripts door het te doen draaien in ``/etc/init.d/rcS``. De ramdisks hebben de namen /etc_ram en /var_ram. De meeste data van /etc en /var is gekopieerd naar deze tmpfs ramdisks. Om de grootte van de ramdisks te limiteren kopieren we verschillende dingen niet over (bijvoorbeeld apt gerelateerde data). We bind mounten ze vervolgens over de originele mappen. Wanneer een applicatie schrijft naar /etc/foo/bar zal het dus eigenlijk schrijven naar /etc_ram/foo/bar.
