How to display several images per product
=========================================

By default your product web page displays the main image of your product only.
If you like to show your products under several angles, you can turn the image into a carrousel.

* Check *Several images per product* in :menuselection:`Website Admin --> Configuration --> Settings`.

* Open a product detail form and upload images from *Images* tab. Hit *Create* in Edit mode to get the upload wizard.
