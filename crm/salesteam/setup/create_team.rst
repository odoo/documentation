How to create a new team?
=========================

In the Sales module, your sales teams are accessible from the
**Dashboard** menu. If you start from a new instance, you will find a
sales team installed by default : Direct sales. You can either start
using that default sales team and edit it (refer to the section
*Create and Organize your stages* from the page :doc:`organize_pipeline`)
or create a new one from scratch.

To create a new team, go to :menuselection:`Configuration --> Sales Teams` and
click on **Create**.
