Duplicating a database
======================

.. note:: Database duplication, renaming, custom DNS, etc. is not available
    to free customers of our Online platform.

Access the `database management page <https://www.odoo.com/my/databases>`__
(you will have to sign in). Next, make sure you are connected as the
administrator of the database you want to duplicate. After that, click
on the **Manage Your Databases** button.

In the line of the database you want to duplicate, you will have a few
buttons. To duplicate your database, just click **Duplicate**. You will
have to give a name to your duplicate, then click **Duplicate Database**.

.. danger:: A duplicated database has the same behaviour as a real one:

  * Emails are sent

  * Payments are processed (in the e-commerce, for example)

  * Delivery orders (shipping providers) are sent

  * Etc.

  It is **strongly** advised to test behaviour using sample
  customers/products (with a `disposable e-mail <http://www.mailinator.com>`__
  address, for example)

After a few seconds, you will be logged in your duplicated database.
Notice that the url uses the name you chose for your duplicated
database.

.. note :: Duplicate databases expire automatically after 15 days.
