Add optional products
=====================

The use of optional products is a marketing strategy for cross-selling products along with a core
product. The aim is to offer useful and related products to your customers. For instance, if a
customer wants to buy a car, he has the choice to order an automatic opening trunk and massaging
seats, or not to order such high-quality products and simply buy his car.

Add optional products to your quotations
========================================

With Odoo Sales, it is possible to add or modify optional products directly on quotations
(under the **Optional Products** tab, as you can see below).

In practice, your customers will be able to add different optional products to their order by
using associated carts, with a user-friendly layout. More than that, if a customer selects all the
optional products suggested, these additional items will automatically fill in the quotation
managed by the salesman.

Like this, salespeople will see each movement made by the customer and tracking the order will be
all the better.
