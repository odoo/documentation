Generating leads with Odoo CRM

What is lead generation?
========================

Lead generation is the process by which a company acquires leads and
collects relevant datas about potential customers in order to enable a
relationship and to turn them into customers.

For example, a website visitor who fills in your contact form to know
more about your products and services becomes a lead for your company.
Typically, a Customer Relationship Management tool such as Odoo CRM is
used to centralize, track and manage leads.

Why is lead generation important for my business?
=================================================

Generating a constant flow of high-quality leads is one of the most
important responsibility of a marketing team. Actually, a well-managed
lead generation process is like the fuel that will allow your company to
deliver great performances - leads bring meetings, meetings bring sales,
sales bring revenue and more work.

How to generate leads with Odoo CRM?
====================================

Leads can be captured through many sources - marketing campaigns,
exhibitions and trade shows, external databases, etc. The most common
challenge is to successfully gather all the data and to track any lead
activity. Storing leads information in a central place such as Odoo CRM
will release you of these worries and will help you to better automate
your lead generation process, share information with your teams and
analyze your sales processes easily.

Odoo CRM provides you with several methods to generate leads:

* :doc:`../../leads/generate/emails`

  An inquiry email sent to one of your company's generic email addresses
  can automatically generate a lead or an opportunity.

* :doc:`../../leads/generate/manual`

  You may want to follow up with a prospective customer met briefly at an
  exhibition who gave you his business card. You can manually create a new
  lead and enter all the needed information.

* :doc:`../../leads/generate/website`

  A website visitor who fills in a form automatically generates a lead or
  an opportunity in Odoo CRM.

* :doc:`../../leads/generate/import`

  You can provide your salespeople lists of prospects - for example for a
  cold emailing or a cold calling campaign - by importing them from any
  CSV file.
