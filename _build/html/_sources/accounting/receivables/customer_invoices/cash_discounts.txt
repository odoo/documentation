How to setup cash discounts?
============================

Cash discounts are an incentive (usually a small percentage) that you
offer to customers in return for paying a bill owed before the scheduled
due date. If used properly, cash discounts improve the Days Sales
Outstanding aspect of a business's cash conversion cycle.

For example, a typical cash discount would be: you offer a 2% discount
on an invoice due in 30 days if the customer were to pay within the
first 5 days of receiving the invoice.

Configuration
=============

Payment terms
-------------

In order to manage cash discounts, we will use the payment terms
concept of Odoo (From the Accounting module, go to :menuselection`Configuration -->
Management --> Payment terms --> Create`).

Let's start with the above example: a 2% discount on an invoice due in
30 days if the customer were to pay within the first 5 days.

A typical payment term of 30 days would have only one installment:
balance in 30 days. But, in order to configure the cash discount, you
can configure the payment term with two installments:

-  98% within 5 days
-  balance within 30 days

To make it clear that it's not a payment term but a cash discount, don't
forget to set a clear description that will appear on the invoice:
Invoice is due within 30 days, but you can benefit from a 2% cash
discount if you pay within 5 days.

Bank reconciliation model
-------------------------

In order to speed up the bank reconciliation process, we can create a
model of entry for all cash discounts. To do that, from the Accounting
application dashboard, click on the "More" link on the bank and choose
the option "Reconciliation Models".

Create a new model for cash discounts as follow:

-  **Button Label**: Cash Discount
-  **Account**: Cash Discount (according to your country)
-  **Amount Type**: Percentage
-  **Amount**: 100%
-  **Taxes**: depending on your country, you may put a tax on the cash
       discount if taxes have to be deduced

.. tip::
	
	Even if it's a 2% cash discount, set a 100% amount on the reconciliation model
	as it means 100% of the remaining balance (the 2%). You can use the same
	reconciliation model for all your cash discount. No need to create a model
	per payment term.

Creating an invoice with a cash discount
========================================

When you create a customer invoice, set the right payment term "30 days,
2% cash discount" right after having selected the customer.

Once the invoice is validated, Odoo will automatically split the account
receivable part of the journal entry with two installments having a
different due date: 98% within 5 days, 2% within 30 days.

Payment

Paying the invoice with a cash discount
---------------------------------------

If the customer pays with a cash discount, when processing the bank
statement, you will match the payment (98%) with the related line in the
journal entry.

As you can see in the above screenshot, when selecting the customer, you
also see the 2% remaining of 3$. If you want to accept the cash discount
(if the customer paid within the 5 days), you can click on this line
with 2%, click on "Open Balance", and select your "Cash Discount"
reconciliation model. That way, the invoice is marked as fully paid.

.. note::

	from now on, matching the remaining 2% has to be done manually. In the future,
	we plan to automate the reconciliation of the 2% if the 98% are paid on time.

Paying the invoice in full
--------------------------

If the customer pays the invoice fully, without benefiting from the cash
discount, you will reconcile the payment (in full) with the two lines
from the invoice (98% and 2%). Just click on the two lines to match them
with the payment.
