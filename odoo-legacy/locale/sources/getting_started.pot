msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started/documentation.rst:107
msgid "**be available at least 2 full days a week** for the project, otherwise you risk slowing down your implementation. More is better with the fastest implementations having a full time project manager."

#: ../../getting_started/documentation.rst:111

msgid "**The project first, customizations second.** If you really want to customize Twenty20, phase it towards the end of the project, ideally after having been in production for several months. Once a customer starts using Twenty20, they usually drop about 60% of their customization requests as they learn to perform their work flows out of the box, or the Twenty20 way. It is more important to have all your business processes working than customizing a screen to add a few fields here and there or automating a few e-mails."
