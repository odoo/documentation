How to use packages?
====================

Overview
========

The package is the physical container in which you put one or several
product.

By default, Odoo does not take into account the use of it.

Once you activate the option, you will be able to manage one or several
packages when doing your transfers.

Configuration
=============

To configure the use of packages, go to the menu 
:menuselection:`Inventory --> Configuration --> Settings`. Âµ
Locate the **Packages** section and tick **Record
packages used on packing: pallets, boxes,...**

Pack products

Putting products in packs is usually done when processing warehouses
transfers (receipt, internals or deliveries).

To be able to put products in pack, the status of your transfer has to
be **Available**.
