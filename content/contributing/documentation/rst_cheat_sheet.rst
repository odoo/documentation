.. _contributing/headings:

Headings
========

| For each formatting line (e.g., ``===``), write as many symbols (``=``) as there are characters in
  the header.
| The symbols used for the formatting are, in fact, not important. Only the order in which they are
  written matters, as it determines the size of the decorated heading. This means that you may
  encounter different heading formatting and in a different order, in which case you should follow
  the formatting in place in the document. In any other case, use the formatting shown below.

+--------------+---------------+
| Heading size | Formatting    |
+==============+===============+
| H1           | | ``=======`` |
|              | | ``Heading`` |
|              | | ``=======`` |
+--------------+---------------+
| H2           | | ``Heading`` |
|              | | ``=======`` |
+--------------+---------------+
| H3           | | ``Heading`` |
|              | | ``-------`` |
+--------------+---------------+
| H4           | | ``Heading`` |
|              | | ``~~~~~~~`` |
+--------------+---------------+
| H5           | | ``Heading`` |
|              | | ``*******`` |
+--------------+---------------+
| H6           | | ``Heading`` |
|              | | ``^^^^^^^`` |
+--------------+---------------+

.. important::
   Each document must have **exactly one H1 heading**. No less, no more.

.. _contributing/bulleted-list:

Bulleted list
-------------

.. code-block:: rst

   - This is a bulleted list.
   - It has two items, the second
     item uses two lines.

.. code-block:: rst

   * This is a bulleted list too.
   * The principle stays the same.

.. _contributing/numbered-list:

Numbered list
-------------

.. code-block:: rst

   #. This is a numbered list.
   #. Numbering is automatic.

.. code-block:: rst

   1. This is a numbered list too.
   2. Use this format to specify the numbering.

.. _contributing/nested-list:

Nested lists
------------

.. code-block:: rst

   - This is the first item of a bulleted list.

     1. It has a nested numbered list
     2. with two items.

.. _contributing/hyperlinks:

Hyperlinks
==========

.. _contributing/hyperlink-references:

Hyperlink references
--------------------

Hyperlink references are links to a URL with a custom label. They follow this syntax:
```label <URL>`_``

.. note::
   The URL can be a relative path to a file within the documentation.

Example
~~~~~~~

This excerpt of :abbr:`RST (reStructuredText)`: ``For instance, `this is a hyperlink reference
<https://odoo.com>`_.`` is rendered as follows in HTML: “For instance, `this is a hyperlink
reference <https://odoo.com>`_.”

.. _contributing/external-hyperlink-targets:

External hyperlink targets
--------------------------

| External hyperlink targets allow creating shortcuts for hyperlink references.
| The definition syntax is as follows: ``.. _target: URL``
| There are two ways to reference them, depending on the use case:

#. ``target_`` creates a hyperlink with the target name as label and the URL as reference. Note that
   the ``_`` moved after the target!
#. ```label <target_>`_`` does exactly what you expect: the label replaces the name of the target,
   and the target is replaced by the URL.

Example
~~~~~~~

RST
***

.. code-block:: rst

   .. _proof-of-concept: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept

   A proof-of-concept_ is a simplified version, a prototype of what is expected to agree on the main
   lines of expected changes. `PoC <proof-of-concept_>`_ is a common abbreviation.

prototype of what is expected to agree on the main lines of expected changes. `PoC

.. _contributing/internal-hyperlink-targets:

Internal hyperlink targets
--------------------------

Internal hyperlink targets follow the same syntax as external hyperlink targets but without any URL.
Indeed, they are internal. They allow referencing a specific part of a document by using the target
as an anchor. When the user clicks on the reference, the documentation scrolls to the part of the
page containing the target.

.. important::
   Targets can be referenced from other files than the ones in which they are defined.

| The definition syntax is: ``.. _target:``
| There are two ways to reference them, both using the ``ref`` directive:

#. ``:ref:`target``` creates a hyperlink to the anchor with the heading defined below as label.
#. ``:ref:`label <target>``` creates a hyperlink to the anchor with the given label.

See :ref:`contributing/relative-links` to learn how to write proper relative links for internal
references.

.. note::
  Notice that there is no ``_`` at the end, as it is done with :ref:`hyperlink targets
  <contributing/hyperlink-references>`.

Example

.. _contributing/implicit-hyperlink-targets:

Implicit hyperlink targets
--------------------------

| Implicit hyperlink targets are a special kind of internal hyperlink targets: they are
  automatically generated by section titles, footnotes, etc. Consequently, they don’t have a
  definition syntax.
| They can be referenced the same first way as external hyperlink targets by using the name of the
  section title as URL.

Example

.. _contributing/doc:

The ``doc`` directive
---------------------

| The ``doc`` directive allows referencing a documentation page wherever it is in the file tree
  through a relative file path.
| As usual, there are two ways to use the directive:

#. ``:doc:`path_to_doc_page``` creates a hyperlink reference to the documentation page with the
   title of the page as label.
#. ``:doc:`label <path_to_doc_page>``` creates a hyperlink reference to the documentation page with
   the given label.

Example
~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: rst

   :doc:`../sales/sales/invoicing/proforma`.

`Send a pro-forma invoice <https://example.com/doc/sales/proforma.html>`_.

.. _contributing/download:

The ``download`` directive
--------------------------

The ``download`` directive allows referencing files (that are not necessarily :abbr:`RST
(reStructuredText)` documents) within the source tree to be downloaded.

Example
~~~~~~~

RST
***

.. code-block:: rst

   Download this :download:`module structure template <extras/my_module.zip>` to start building your

.. _contributing/image:

parameter directives that can individually be omitted if considered redundant.

.. _contributing/comments:

Add comments
------------

If you made a particular choice of writing or formatting that a future writer should be able to
understand and take into account, consider writing a comment. Comments are blocks of text that do
not count as a part of the documentation and that are used to pass a message to writers of the
source code. They consist of a line starting with two dots and a space, followed by the comment.

``.. For instance, this line will not be rendered in the documentation.``

Make use of `this convenient table generator <https://www.tablesgenerator.com/text_tables>`_ to
build your tables. Then, copy-paste the generated formatting into your document.

.. _contributing/escaping:

Escape markup symbols (Advanced)
--------------------------------

Markup symbols escaped with backslashes (``\``) are rendered normally. For instance, ``this
\*\*line of text\*\* with \*markup\* symbols`` is rendered as “this \*\*line of text\*\* with
\*markup\* symbols”.

When it comes to backticks (`````), which are used in many case such as :ref:`hyperlink references
<contributing/hyperlink-references>`, using backslashes for escaping is no longer an option because
the outer backticks interpret enclosed backslashes and thus prevent them from escaping inner
backticks. For instance, ```\`this formatting\```` produces an ``[UNKNOWN NODE title_reference]``
error. Instead, `````this formatting````` should be used to produce the following result:
```this formatting```.
