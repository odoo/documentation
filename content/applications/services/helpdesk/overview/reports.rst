============================
Reports for a Better Support
============================

An efficient customer service solution should have a built-in reporting option. Reports allow you to
track trends, identify areas for improvement, manage employees’ workloads and, most importantly,
meet your customer’s expectations.

Cases
~~~~~

Some examples of the reports Odoo Helpdesk can generate include:

- The number of tickets *grouped by* team and ticket type.

| In this manner, you are able to evaluate which ticket types have been the most frequent ones,
  plus the workload of your teams.
| Apply *Time Ranges* if you would like to make comparisons to a *Previous Period* or a *Previous
  Year*.

- The number of tickets closed per day, per team.

Get an overview of how many requests each team is closing per day in order to measure their
performance. Identify productivity levels to understand how many requests they are able to handle.

.. tip::
   Filter it by *Assignee* to see Key Performance Indicators (KPI) per agent.

- The number of hours tickets are taking to be solved, grouped by team and ticket type.

Check if your expectations are met by *measuring* the *Time to close (hours)*. Your
customers not only expect fast responses but they also want their issues to be handled quickly.

Save filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Save the filters you use the most and avoid having to reconstruct them every time they are
needed. To do so, set the groups, filters, and measures needed. Then, go to *Favorites*.
