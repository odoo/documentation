Project management
==================

Odoo Project uses the **Kanban** project management system. This means all projects are broken down
into tasks, which are categorized on a whiteboard according to what production phase they are in.

.. admonition:: Did you know?

   The word **Kanban** comes from Japanese and refers to the "visual board" management method.

Configuration
=============

Open the **Project** app and click :guilabel:`Create` to start a new project. Enter a
:guilabel:`Name` for your project and click :guilabel:`Create Project`.

You can customize your existing **projects** from the dashboard by clicking the drop-down toggle
button (:guilabel:`⋮`) on your project's **card**.

   :align: center
   :alt: Project card

This enables a new menu divided into four parts:

- :guilabel:`View`: see an overview of your project's components, such as its :guilabel:`Tasks`,
  :guilabel:`Milestones` and :guilabel:`Project Updates`. Depending on which apps you have
  activated, more options may be available, such as :guilabel:`Documents`. All uploaded files can be
  found under this menu, as well as in the **Documents** app, under :guilabel:`Projects`;
- :guilabel:`Reporting`: analyze your project's progress and profitability through graphics and
  statistics;
- **Color**: make a line of color appear on the left side of the card so that your project is more
  recognizable;
- :guilabel:`Settings`: you can change the following:

  - the :guilabel:`Name` of the project;
  - the :guilabel:`Name of the tasks` found under that project;
  - the :guilabel:`Customer` for whom the project is intended;
  - the :guilabel:`Tags` used for filtering;
  - the :guilabel:`Company` responsible for the project;
  - the employee designated as :guilabel:`Project Manager`;
  - the :guilabel:`Planned Date` of the project;
  - the total :guilabel:`Allocated Hours` for that project.

Additionally, you can mark the project as :guilabel:`Favorite`, allowing you to find it using the
:guilabel:`My Favorites` filter on the Kanban view;

Further settings are available under the :guilabel:`Settings` tab. Most of them are *only* available
depending on the activated apps.

Scheduling activities
=====================

You can schedule **activities** (ex. :guilabel:`Call`, :guilabel:`Meeting`, etc.) per project by
clicking on the **clock** icon on a project. Doing so opens a list with already scheduled activities
and allows planning **new** activities by clicking :guilabel:`+ Schedule an activity`. On the pop-up
window, select the :guilabel:`Activity Type`, enter a :guilabel:`Summary` for that activity, a
:guilabel:`Due Date`, and assign it to an employee. According to the :guilabel:`Activity Type`, you
may have **additional options** available.

.. note::
   If an activity is **already** scheduled, the icon may change to a **phone**, **group of people**,
   or other.
