Javascript Reference
====================

This document presents the Odoo Javascript framework. This
framework is not a large application in term of lines of code, but it is quite
generic, because it is basically a machine to turn a declarative interface
description into a live application, able to interact with every model and
records in the database.  It is even possible to use the web client to modify
the interface of the web client.

Overview
========

The Javascript framework is designed to work with three main use cases:

- the *web client*: this is the private web application, where one can view and
  edit business data. This is a single page application (the page is never
  reloaded, only the new data is fetched from the server whenever it is needed)
- the *website*: this is the public part of Odoo.  It allows an unidentified
  user to browse some content, to shop or to perform many actions, as a client.
  This is a classical website: various routes with controllers and some
  javascript to make it work.
- the *point of sale*: this is the interface for the point of sale. It is a
  specialized single page application.

Some javascript code is common to these three use cases, and is bundled together
(see below in the assets section).  This document will focus mostly on the architecture
of the web client.

Web client
==========

Single Page Application
-----------------------

The web client is a single-page application: instead of
requesting a full page from the server each time the user performs an action,
it only loads what is needed to update the user interface (UI) as a result of that
action. While doing this, it also takes care of updating information in the URL,
so that, in most cases, refreshing the page or closing the browser and opening it
again shows you the same thing.

Overview of web client JS code
------------------------------

Here, we give a very quick overview of the web client code, in the :file:`web` addon.
The paths will be described relative to :file:`web/static/src`.
The following description is deliberately not exhaustive; the goal is only to
give the reader a bird's eye view of the architecture.

- :file:`module_loader.js`: this is the file that defines the Odoo javascript module
  system.  It needs to be loaded before any other JS module.
- :file:`core/`: this folder contains code that forms the lowest level of the javascript
  framework and that can be used in the web client as well as the website, portal,
  and point of sale application.
- :file:`weblient/`: this folder contains files that are specific to the web client and
  cannot be used in the website or point of sale, such as the action manager and the
  action service.
- :file:`webclient/webclient.js`: this is the webclient component proper. It is mostly
  a wrapper for the action container and the navbar, and does a few things that
  are required upon starting the application, such as loading the state of the url.
- :file:`webclient/actions/`: this folder contains the code responsible for displaying
  and switching between actions.
- :file:`views/`: this folder contains the code for the view infrastructure, as well
  as most of the views (some types of views are added by other addons).
- :file:`views/fields/`: contains the definition of the various field components, as well
  as some utilities used by multiple fields.
- :file:`search/` all these files define the search view (it is not a view
  in the point of view of the web client, only from the server point of view)


What to do if a file is not loaded/updated
------------------------------------------

There are many different reasons why a file may not be properly loaded.  Here
are a few things you can try to solve the issue:

- Make sure you saved your file; forgetting to do that happens to the best of us.
- Take a look at the console (in the dev tools, usually opened with F12) and check
  for errors.
- Try adding a `console.log()` at the beginning of your file so you can see if
  a file has been loaded or not. If it is not loaded, if may not be in the proper
  assets bundle, or the asset bundle may not be up to date.
- Depending on your settings, the server may not regenerate the assets bundles
  after a file has been modified; there are a few options to solve this:

  - restarting the server will force it to check if the asset bundle is up to
    date the next time it is requested
  - in debug mode, there is an option in the debug menu (:icon:`fa-bug` button in the navbar)
    to force the server to regenerate the assets bundle on the fly without restarting.
  - starting the server with the `--dev=xml` option will force the server to check
    if an asset bundle is up to date every time it is requested. We advise you to use
    this option when actively developing, but not in production.

- Make sure you refresh your page after changing the code. Odoo currently does not
  have any hot module reloading mechanism.


Loading Javascript Code
=======================

Large applications are usually broken up into smaller files, that need to be
connected together.  Some file may need to use code defined in
another file. There are two ways of sharing code between files:

- using the global scope (the *window* object) to read/write references to some
  objects or functions,

- using a module system that will provide a way for each modules to export or import
  values, and will make sure that they are loaded in a proper order.

While it's possible to work in the global scope, this has a number of issues:

- It is difficult to ensure that implementation details are not exposed: function
  declarations in the global scope are accessible to all other code.

- There is a single namespace, creating great potential for naming conflicts.

- Dependencies are implicit: if a piece of code depends on another, the order in
  which they are loaded is important, but difficult to guarantee.

Using a module system helps resolve these issues: because modules specify their
dependencies, the module system can load them in the proper order or emit an error
if dependencies are missing or circular. Modules also form their own namespace,
and can choose what to export, preventing exposure of implementation detail and
naming collisions.

While we could use ECMAScript (ES) modules directly, there are a number of
disadvantages to that approach: each ES module requires a network round trip, which
becomes very slow when you have hundreds of files, and many files in Odoo need to
be present despite not being imported by anything because they simply add code
that the framework will use instead of the other way around.

Because of this, Odoo has a system of asset bundles. In these bundles, JavaScript
files are ES modules with a special annotation at the top. These modules will be
bundled together and transpiled to be usable by our module loader. While you can
write code that doesn't use this module system, it is generally not recommended.

(see :ref:`frontend/modules/native_js`)


Patching classes
----------------

While we do our best to provide extension points that don't require it, it is
sometimes necessary to modify the behavior of an existing class *in place*. The
goal is to have a mechanism to change a class and all future/present instances.
This is done by using the `patch` utility function:

.. code-block:: javascript

    /** @odoo-module */
    import { Hamster } from "@web/core/hamster"
    import { patch } from "@web/core/utils/patch";

    patch(Hamster.prototype, {
        sleep() {
            super.sleep(...arguments);
            console.log("zzzz");
        },
    });

When patching methods, you need to patch the class' prototype, but if you would
like to patch a static property of the class, you need to patch the class itself.

Patching is a dangerous operation and should be done with care as it will
modify all instances of the class, even if they have already been created. To
avoid weird issues, patches should be applied as soon as possible, at the
top-level of your module. Patching classes at runtime can result in extremely
difficult to debug issues if the class has already been instanciated.

Registries
==========

A common need in the Odoo ecosystem is to extend/change the behaviour of the
base system from the outside (by installing an application, i.e. a different
module).  For example, one may need to add a new field widget in some views. In
that case, and many others, the usual process is to create the desired component,
then add it to a registry (registering step), to make the rest of the web client
aware of its existence.

There are a few registries available in the system. The registries that are used
by the framework are categories on the main registry, that can be imported from
:js:data:`@web/core/registry`

field registry
  The field registry contains all field widgets known to the web client.
  Whenever a view (typically form or list/kanban) needs a field widget, this
  is where it will look. A typical use case look like this:

  .. code-block:: javascript

      import { registry } from "@web/core/registry";
      class PadField extends Component { ... }

      registry.category("fields").add("pad", {
        component: PadField,
        supportedTypes: ["char"],
        // ...
      });

view registry
  This registry contains all JS views known to the web client.

action registry
  We keep track of all client actions in this registry.  This
  is where the action manager looks up whenever it needs to create a client
  action. Client actions can be a function - the function will be called when the
  action is invoked, and the returned value will be executed as a follow up action
  if needed - or an Owl component that will be displayed when executing that action.

Services
========

Within the webclient, there are some concerns that cannot be handled by a single
component, as the concern is transversal, involves many components, or needs to
maintain some state for as long as the application is alive.

Services are a solution to these problems: they are created during application
startup, are available to components through the hook `useService`, and stay
alive for the entire lifetime of the application.

For example, we have the *orm* service whose job is to allow interacting with
business objects on the server.

Here is a simplified example on how the orm service is implemented:

.. code-block:: javascript

    import { registry } from "@web/core/registry";
    export const OrmService = {
        start() {
            return {
                read(...) { ... },
                write(...) { ... },
                unlink(...) { ... },
                ...
            }
        },
    };
    registry.category("services").add("orm", OrmService);

Using services
--------------

Services are available in the environment, but should generally be used through
the `useService` hook, which prevents calling methods on the service after a
component has been destroyed, and prevents further code from executing after a
method call if the component was destroyed during the call.

.. code-block:: javascript

    class SomeComponent extends Component {
        setup() {
            this.orm = useService("orm");
        }
        // ...
        getActivityModelViewID(model) {
            return this.orm.call(model, "get_activity_view_id", this.params);
        }
    }

Talking to the server
---------------------

There are typically two use cases when working on Odoo: one may need to call a
method on a (python) model (this goes through the controller `/web/dataset/call_kw`),
or one may need to directly call a controller (available on some route).

* Calling a method on a python model is done through the orm service:

  .. code-block:: javascript

      return this.orm.call("some.model", "some_method", [some, args]);

* Directly calling a controller is done through the rpc service:

  .. code-block:: javascript

      return this.rpc("/some/route/", {
          some: param,
      });

.. note::
    The rpc service doesn't really perform what is generally understood as a
    remote procedure call (RPC), but for historical reasons, within Odoo we
    generally call any network request performed in JavaScript an RPC. As
    highlighted in the previous paragraph, if you want to call a method on a
    model, you should use the orm service.

Notifications
=============

The Odoo framework has a standard way to communicate various information to the
user: notifications, which are displayed on the top right of the user interface.
The types of notification follow the bootstrap toasts:

- *info*: useful to display some informational feedback as a consequence of an
  action that cannot fail.

- *success*: the user performed an action that can sometimes fail but didn't.

- *warning*: the user performed an action that could only be partially completed.
  Also useful if something is wrong but wasn't caused by the user directly, or
  is not particularly actionable.

- *success*: the user tried to performed an action but it couldn't be completed.


Notifications can also be used to ask a question to the user without disturbing
their workflow: e.g. a phone call received through VOIP: a sticky notification
could be displayed with two buttons to *Accept* or *Decline*.

Displaying notifications
------------------------

There are two ways to display notifications in Odoo:

- The *notification* service allows component to display notifications from JS
  code by calling the add method.

- The *display_notification* client action allows to trigger the display
  of a notification from python (e.g. in the method called when the user
  clicked on a button of type object). This client action uses the notification
  service.

Notifications have a few *options*:

- *title*: string, optional. This will be displayed on the top as a title.

- *message*: string, optional. The content of the notification. Can be a markup
  object to display formatted text.

- *sticky*: boolean, optional (default false). If true, the notification
  will stay until the user dismisses it.  Otherwise, the notification will
  be automatically closed after a short delay.

- *type*: string, optional (default "warning"). Determines the style of the
  notification. Possible values: "info", "success", "warning", "danger"

- *className*: string, optional.  This is a css class name that will be
  automatically added to the notification. This could be useful for styling
  purpose, even though its use is discouraged.

Here are some examples on how to display notifications in JS:

.. code-block:: javascript

    // note that we call _t on the text to make sure it is properly translated.
    this.notification.add({
        title: _t("Success"),
        message: _t("Your signature request has been sent.")
    });
    this.notification.add({
        title: _t("Error"),
        message: _t("Filter name is required."),
        type: "danger",
    });

And in Python:

.. code-block:: python

    # note that we call _(string) on the text to make sure it is properly translated.
    def show_notification(self):
        return {
            'type': 'ir.actions.client',
            'tag': 'display_notification',
            'params': {
                'title': _('Success'),
                'message': _('Your signature request has been sent.'),
                'sticky': False,
            }
        }

Systray
=======

The Systray is the right part of the navbar in the interface, where the web
client displays a few widgets, such as the messaging menu.

When the systray is created by the navbar, it will look for all registered
systray items and display them.

There is currently no specific API for systray items.  They are Owl components,
and can communicate with their environment just like other components, e.g. by
interacting with services.

Adding a new Systray Item
-------------------------

Items can be added to the systray by adding them to the "systray" registry:

.. code-block:: javascript

    import { registry } from "@web/core/registry"
    class MySystrayComponent extends Component {
        ...
    }
    registry.category("systray").add("MySystrayComponent", MySystrayComponent, { sequence: 1 });

The items are ordered in the systray according to their sequence in the systray
registry.

Translation management
======================

Some translations are made on the server side (basically all text strings rendered or
processed by the server), but there are strings in the static files that need
to be translated. The way it currently works is the following:

- each translatable string is tagged with the special function *_t*
- these strings are used by the server to generate the proper PO files
- whenever the web client is loaded, it will call the route */web/webclient/translations*,
  which returns a list of all translatable terms
- at runtime, whenever the function `_t` is called, it will look up in this list
  in order to find a translation, and return it or the original string if none
  is found.

Note that translations are explained in more details, from the server point of
view, in the document :doc:`/developer/howtos/translations`.

.. code-block:: javascript

    import { _t } from "@web/core/l10n/translation";

    class SomeComponent extends Component {
        static exampleString = _t("this should be translated");
        ...
        someMethod() {
            const str = _t("some text");
        }
    }

Note that using the translation function requires some care: the string given as
an argument cannot be dynamic, as it is extracted statically from the code to
generate the PO files and serves as the identifier for the term to translate. If
you need to inject some dynamic content in the string, `_t` supports placeholders:

.. code-block:: javascript

    import { _t } from "@web/core/l10n/translation";
    const str = _t("Hello %s, you have %s unread messages.", user.name, unreadCount);

Notice how the string itself is fixed. This allows the translation function to
retrieve the translated string *before* using it for interpolation.


Session
=======

The webclient needs some information from the python to function properly. To
avoid an extra round-trip with the server by making a network request in JavaScript,
this information is serialized directly in the page, and can be accessed in JS
through the `@web/session` module.

Adding information to the session
---------------------------------

When the `/web` route is loaded, the server injects this information in a script
tag. The information is obtained by calling the method `session_info` of
the model `ir.http`. You can override this method to add information to the
returned dictionary.

.. code-block:: python

    from odoo import models
    from odoo.http import request

    class IrHttp(models.AbstractModel):
        _inherit = 'ir.http'

        def session_info(self):
            result = super(IrHttp, self).session_info()
            result['some_key'] = get_some_value_from_db()
            return result

Now, the value can be obtained in javascript by reading it in the session:

.. code-block:: javascript

    import { session } from "@web/session"
    const myValue = session.some_key;
    ...

Note that this mechanism is designed to reduce the amount of communication
needed by the web client to be ready.  It is only appropriate for data which is
cheap to compute (a slow session_info call will delay the loading for the web
client for everyone), and for data which is required early in the initialization
process.

Views
=====

The word "view" has more than one meaning. This section is about the design of
the javascript code of the views, not the structure of the *arch* or anything
else.

While views are just owl components, the built-in views generally have the same
structure: a component called "SomethingController" which is the root of the view.
This component creates an instance of some "model" (an object responsible for
managing the data), and has a subcomponent called a "renderer" that handles the
display logic.

.. _reference/js/widgets:

Fields
======

A good part of the web client experience is about editing and creating data. Most
of that work is done with the help of field widgets, which are aware of the field
type and of the specific details on how a value should be displayed and edited.

.. _reference/javascript_reference/field_decoration:

Decorations
-----------

Like the list view, field widgets have a simple support for decorations. The
goal of decorations is to have a simple way to specify a text color depending on
the record current state.  For example:

.. code-block:: xml

    <field name="state" decoration-danger="amount &lt; 10000"/>

The valid decoration names are:

- `decoration-bf`
- `decoration-it`
- `decoration-danger`
- `decoration-info`
- `decoration-muted`
- `decoration-primary`
- `decoration-success`
- `decoration-warning`

Each decoration *decoration-X* will be mapped to a css class *text-X*, which is
a standard bootstrap css class (except for *text-it* and *text-bf*, which are
handled by odoo and correspond to italic and bold, respectively).  Note that the
value of the decoration attribute should be a valid python expression, which
will be evaluated with the record as evaluation context.

Non-relational fields
---------------------

We document here all non relational fields available by default, in no particular
order.

Integer (`integer`)
    This is the default field type for fields of type `integer`.

    - Supported field types: `integer`

    Options:

    - `type`: setting the input type (`"text"` by default, can be set on `"number"`)

        In edit mode, the field is rendered as an input with the HTML attribute type
        set on `"number"` (so user can benefit the native support, especially on
        mobile). In this case, the default formatting is disabled to avoid incompability.

        .. code-block:: xml

            <field name="int_value" options="{'type': 'number'}" />

    - `step`: set the step to the value up and down when the user click on buttons
      (only for input of type number, `1` by default)

        .. code-block:: xml

            <field name="int_value" options="{'type': 'number', 'step': 100}" />

    - `format`: should the number be formatted. (`true` by default)

        By default, numbers are formatted according to locale parameters.
        This option will prevent the field's value from being formatted.

        .. code-block:: xml

            <field name="int_value" options='{"format": false}' />

Float (`float`)
    This is the default field type for fields of type `float`.

    - Supported field types: `float`

    Attributes:

    - `digits`: displayed precision

        .. code-block:: xml

            <field name="factor" digits="[42,5]" />

    Options:

    - `type`: setting the input type (`"text"` by default, can be set on `"number"`)

        In edit mode, the field is rendered as an input with the HTML attribute type
        set on `"number"` (so user can benefit the native support, especially on
        mobile). In this case, the default formatting is disabled to avoid incompability.

        .. code-block:: xml

            <field name="int_value" options="{'type': 'number'}" />

    - `step`: set the step to the value up and down when the user click on buttons
      (only for input of type number, `1` by default)

        .. code-block:: xml

            <field name="int_value" options="{'type': 'number', 'step': 0.1}" />

    - `format`: should the number be formatted. (`true` by default)

        By default, numbers are formatted according to locale parameters.
        This option will prevent the field's value from being formatted.

        .. code-block:: xml

            <field name="int_value" options="{'format': false}" />

Time (`float_time`)
    The goal of this widget is to display properly a float value that represents
    a time interval (in hours).  So, for example, `0.5` should be formatted as `0:30`,
    or `4.75` correspond to `4:45`.

    - Supported field types: `float`

Float Factor (`float_factor`)
    This widget aims to display properly a float value that converted using a factor
    given in its options. So, for example, the value saved in database is `0.5` and the
    factor is `3`, the widget value should be formatted as `1.5`.

    - Supported field types: `float`

Float Toggle (`float_toggle`)
    The goal of this widget is to replace the input field by a button containing a
    range of possible values (given in the options). Each click allows the user to loop
    in the range. The purpose here is to restrict the field value to a predefined selection.
    Also, the widget support the factor conversion as the `float_factor` widget (Range values
    should be the result of the conversion).

    - Supported field types: `float`

    .. code-block:: xml

        <field name="days_to_close" widget="float_toggle" options="{'factor': 2, 'range': [0, 4, 8]}" />

Boolean (`boolean`)
    This is the default field type for fields of type `boolean`.

    - Supported field types: `boolean`

Char (`char`)
    This is the default field type for fields of type `char`.

    - Supported field types: `char`

.. _reference/javascript_reference/date_field:

Date (`date`)
    This is the default field type for fields of type `date`. It consists of a text
    box and a date picker.

    - Supported field types: `date`

    Options:

    - `min_date` / `max_date`: sets limit dates for accepted values. By default, the earliest
      accepted date is **1000-01-01** and the latest is **9999-12-31**.
      Accepted values are SQL-formatted dates (`yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`) or `"today"`.

        .. code-block:: xml

            <field name="datefield" options="{'min_date': 'today', 'max_date': '2023-12-31'}" />

    - warn_future: displays a warning if the value is in the future (based on today).

        .. code-block:: xml

            <field name="datefield" options="{'warn_future': true}" />

.. _reference/javascript_reference/datetime_field:

Date & Time (`datetime`)
    This is the default field type for fields of type `datetime`. The values are always
    in the client's timezone.

    - Supported field types: `datetime`

    Options:

    - see :ref:`Date Field <reference/javascript_reference/date_field>` options

    - `rounding`: increment used to generate available minutes in the time picker.
      This does not affect the actual value, just the amount of available options in
      the select dropdown (default: `5`).

        .. code-block:: xml

            <field name="datetimefield" options="{'rounding': 10}" />

Date Range (`daterange`)
    This widget allows the user to select start and end date from a single picker.

    - Supported field types: `date`, `datetime`

    Options:

    - see :ref:`Date Field <reference/javascript_reference/date_field>` or :ref:`Date & Time Field <reference/javascript_reference/datetime_field>` options

    - `start_date_field`: field used to get/set the start value of the date range
      (cannot be used with `end_date_field`).

        .. code-block:: xml

            <field name="end_date" widget="daterange" options="{'start_date_field': 'start_date'}" />

    - `end_date_field`: field used to get/set the end value of the date range
      (cannot be used with `start_date_field`).

        .. code-block:: xml

            <field name="start_date" widget="daterange" options="{'end_date_field': 'end_date'}" />

Remaining Days (`remaining_days`)
    This widget can be used on date and datetime fields. In readonly, it displays
    the delta (in days) between the value of the field and today. The widget turns
    into a regular date or datetime field in edit mode.

    - Supported field types: `date`, `datetime`

Monetary (`monetary`)
    This is the default field type for fields of type `monetary`. It is used to
    display a currency.  If there is a currency fields given in option, it will
    use that, otherwise it will fall back to the default currency (in the session)

    - Supported field types: `monetary`, `float`

    Options:

    - `currency_field`: another field name which should be a many2one on currency.

        .. code-block:: xml

            <field name="value" widget="monetary" options="{'currency_field': 'currency_id'}" />

Text (`text`)
    This is the default field type for fields of type `text`.

    - Supported field types: `text`


Handle (`handle`)
    This field's job is to be displayed as a `handle`, and allows reordering the
    various records by drag and dropping them.

    .. warning:: It has to be specified on the field by which records are sorted.
    .. warning:: Having more than one field with a handle widget on the same list is not supported.

    - Supported field types: `integer`


Email (`email`)
    This field displays email address.  The main reason to use it is that it
    is rendered as an anchor tag with the proper href, in readonly mode.

    - Supported field types: `char`

Phone (`phone`)
    This field displays a phone number.  The main reason to use it is that it
    is rendered as an anchor tag with the proper href, in readonly mode, but
    only in some cases: we only want to make it clickable if the device can
    call this particular number.

    - Supported field types: `char`

URL (`url`)
    This field displays an url (in readonly mode). The main reason to use it is
    that it is rendered as an anchor tag with the proper css classes and href.

    Also, the text of the anchor tag can be customized with the *text* attribute
    (it won't change the href value).

    - Supported field types: `char`

    .. code-block:: xml

        <field name="foo" widget="url" text="Some URL" />

    Options:

    - `website_path`: (default: `false`) by default, the widget forces (if not already
      the case) the href value to begin with `"http://"` except if this option is set
      to `true`, thus allowing redirections to the database's own website.

Domain (`domain`)
    The `domain` field allows the user to construct a technical-prefix domain
    thanks to a tree-like interface and see the selected records in real time.
    In debug mode, an input is also there to be able to enter the prefix char
    domain directly (or to build advanced domains the tree-like interface does
    not allow to).

    Note that this is limited to **static** domains (no dynamic expressions, or access
    to context variable).

    - Supported field types: `char`

Link button (`link_button`)
    The `LinkButton` widget actually simply displays a span with an icon and the
    text value as content. The link is clickable and will open a new browser
    window with its value as url.

    - Supported field types: `char`

Image File (`image`)
    This widget is used to represent a binary value as an image. In some cases,
    the server returns a `bin_size` instead of the real image (a `bin_size` is a
    string representing a file size, such as `"6.5kb"`).  In that case, the widget
    will make an image with a source attribute corresponding to an image on the
    server.

    - Supported field types: `binary`

    Options:

    - `preview_image`: if the image is only loaded as a `bin_size`, then this
      option is useful to inform the web client that the default field name is
      not the name of the current field, but the name of another field.

        .. code-block:: xml

            <field name="image" widget="image" options="{'preview_image': 'image_128'}" />

    - `accepted_file_extensions`: the file extension the user can pick from the file input dialog box
      (default value is `"image/\*"`)

        (cf: ``accept`` attribute on `<input type="file" />`)

Binary File (`binary`)
    Generic widget to allow saving/downloading a binary file.

    - Supported field types: `binary`

    Attributes:

    - `filename`: saving a binary file will lose its file name, since it only
      saves the binary value. The file name can be saved in another field. To do
      that, a `filename` attribute should be set to a field present in the view.

        .. code-block:: xml

            <field name="datas" filename="datas_fname" />

    Options:

    - `accepted_file_extensions`: the file extension the user can pick from the file input dialog box

        (cf: ``accept`` attribute on `<input type="file" />`)

Priority (`priority`)
    This widget is rendered as a set of stars, allowing the user to click on it
    to select a value or not. This is useful for example to mark a task as high
    priority.

    - Supported field types: `selection`

Image Attachment (`attachment_image`)
    Image widget for `many2one` fields. If the field is set, this widget will be

    image.

                />
            </button>

Percent Pie (`percentpie`)
    This widget is meant to represent statistical information in a `stat button`.

Client actions
==============

A client action is a component that can be displayed as the main element in the
webclient, occupying all the space below the navbar, just like an `act_window_action`.
This is useful when you need a component that is not closely linked to an existing
view or a specific model.  For example, the Discuss application is a client action.

A client action is a term that has various meanings, depending on the context:

- from the perspective of the server, it is a record of the model *ir_action*,
  with a field *tag* of type char
- from the perspective of the web client, it is an Owl component registered in the
  action registry under the same key its tag

Whenever a menu item is associated with a client action, opening it will simply
fetch the action definition from the server, then lookup its tag in the action
registry to get the component definition. This component will then be rendered by
the action container.

Adding a client action
----------------------

A client action is a component that will control the part of the screen below the
navbar. Defining a client action is as simple as creating an Owl component and
adding it to the action registry.

.. code-block:: javascript

    import { registry } from "@web/core/registry";
    class MyClientAction extends Component { ... }
    registry.category("actions").add("my-custom-action", ClientAction);

Then, to use the client action in the web client, we need to create a client
action record (a record of the model ``ir.actions.client``) with the proper
``tag`` attribute:

.. code-block:: xml

    <record id="my_client_action" model="ir.actions.client">
        <field name="name">Some Name</field>
        <field name="tag">my-custom-action</field>
    </record>
