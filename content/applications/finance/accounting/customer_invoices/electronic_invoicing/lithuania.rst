Odoo electronic invoicing in Lithuania
======================================

Odoo Invoicing is your trusted partner for safe, efficient, and legally compliant e-invoicing
solutions tailored to Lithuania's regulatory standards.

Legal framework for e-invoicing in Lithuania
============================================

In Lithuania, e-invoicing is regulated under the `Law on Accounting <https://www.e-tar.lt/portal/lt/legalAct/207ad17030a011e78397ae072f58c508>`_
and aligned with `EU Directive 2014/55/EU <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014L0055>`_
for mandatory :abbr:`B2G (business-to-government)` e-invoicing. Lithuania participates in the
Peppol network, enabling seamless cross-border e-invoicing. While B2B e-invoicing is currently
optional, its use is encouraged to enhance tax compliance and operational efficiency.

Compliance with Lithuanian e-invoicing regulations
==================================================

Odoo invoicing module is fully equipped to meet Lithuania's e-invoicing requirements and ensure
compliance with local and EU standards. Here is how Odoo ensures compliance:

  tamper-proof system, ensuring they are accessible for audits and tax inspections.

  invoices meet Lithuaniaâ€™s VAT requirements for both B2G and B2B transactions, reducing the risk of
