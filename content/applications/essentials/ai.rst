The AI app, combined with the `ai_fields` module and AI agent, are integrated throughout Odoo to
automate and streamline everyday tasks.

The core AI logic and capabilities are separate from the regular Odoo user interface, so AI
capabilities are added without changing existing modules, and added on top of Odoo as an additional
layer, so existing modules do not need to be modified to support AI features.

Integrating the use of artificial intelligence in Odoo is a no-code solution of making
customizations and improvements to Odoo databases.
