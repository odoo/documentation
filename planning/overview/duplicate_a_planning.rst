Create a Schedule and Make Encoding Easier
==========================================

Organize regular schedules or forecast projects in a long term basis. Create shifts to manage your
tasks, assign employees, and stay organized at a high level.

Organize your team by roles
===========================

Go to :menuselection:`Configuration --> Roles --> Create`.
Optionally, go to the *Employees* application, select the respective employee, and under *Work
Information* select the *Default Planning Role*.

Make shifts recurrent
=====================

While creating a shift, select *Repeat* and configure as needed, saving you from the need
of re-planning it.
