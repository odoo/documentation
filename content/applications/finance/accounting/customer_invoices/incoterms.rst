Incoterms
=========

:abbr:`Incoterms (International Commercial Terms)` are standardized trade terms used in
international transactions to define the rights and responsibilities of buyers and sellers. They
establish the obligations related to the delivery of goods, the transfer of risks, and the
distribution of costs between the parties involved. Incoterms specify important details, such as the
point at which the risk and costs transfer from the seller to the buyer, the responsibility for
transportation, insurance, customs clearance, and other relevant aspects of the transaction.
