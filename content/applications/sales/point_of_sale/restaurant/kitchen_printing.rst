To ease the workflow between the front of house and the back of the
house, printing the orders taken on the PoS interface right in the
kitchen or bar can be a tremendous help.

================================

To activate the *Order printing* feature, go to :menuselection:`Point
of Sales --> Configuration --> Point of sale` and select your PoS
interface.

Under the IoT Box / Hardware Proxy category, you will find *Order Printers*.
Note that you need an IoT Box to connect your Printer to the PoS.
