=============
Authorize.Net
=============

`Authorize.Net <https://www.authorize.net>`_ is a United States-based online payment solution
provider, allowing businesses to accept **credit cards**.

Configuration
=============

.. seealso::
   - :ref:`payment_providers/add_new`

Credentials tab
---------------

Odoo needs your **API Credentials & Keys** to connect with your Authorize.Net account, which
comprise:

- **API Login ID**: The ID solely used to identify the account with Authorize.Net.
- **API Transaction Key**
- **API Signature Key**
- **API Client Key**

To retrieve them, log into your Authorize.Net account, go to :menuselection:`Account --> Settings
--> Security Settings --> API Credentials & Keys`, generate your **Transaction Key** and
**Signature Key**, and paste them on the related fields in Odoo. Then, click on **Generate Client
Key**.

.. important::
   To test Authorize.Net with a *sandbox* account, change the :guilabel:`State` to :guilabel:`Test
   Mode`. We recommend doing this on a test Odoo database, rather than on your main database.

   If you use the :guilabel:`Test Mode` with a regular account, it results in the following error:
   *The merchant login ID or password is invalid or the account is inactive*.

Configuration tab
-----------------

Place a hold on a card
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With Authorize.Net, you can enable the :ref:`manual capture
<payment_providers/manual_capture>`. If enabled, the funds are reserved for 30 days on the
customer's card, but not charged yet.

.. warning::
   After **30 days**, the transaction is **voided automatically** by Authorize.Net.

   - :doc:`../payment_providers`

.. _authorize/ach_payments:

ACH payments (USA only)
=======================

:abbr:`ACH (automated clearing house)` is an electronic funds transfer system used between bank
accounts in the United States.

Configuration
-------------

To give customers the possibility to pay using ACH, `sign up for Authorize.Net eCheck's service
<https://www.authorize.net/payments/echeck.html>`_. Once eCheck is activated, duplicate the
previously configured Authorize.Net payment provider on Odoo by going to :menuselection:`Accounting
--> Configuration --> Payment Providers --> Authorize.net`. Then, click the cog icon
(:guilabel:`â›­`) and select :guilabel:`Duplicate`. Change the provider's name to differentiate both
versions (e.g., `Authorize.net - Banks`).

When ready, change the provider's :guilabel:`State` to :guilabel:`Enabled` for a regular account or
:guilabel:`Test Mode` for a sandbox account.

Import an Authorize.Net statement
=================================

.. _authorize-import-template:

Export from Authorize.Net
-------------------------

.. admonition:: Template

   :download:`Download the Excel import template. <authorize/authorize-net-magic-sheet.xlsx>`

- Log in to Authorize.Net.
- Go to :menuselection:`Account --> Statements --> eCheck.Net Settlement Statement`.
- Define an export range using an *opening* and *closing* batch settlement. All transactions within
  the two batch settlements will be exported to Odoo.
- Select all transactions within the desired range, copy them, and paste them into the
  :guilabel:`Report 1 Download` sheet of the :ref:`Excel import template
  <authorize-import-template>`.

   :alt: Selecting Authorize.Net transactions to import

.. example::

   .. image:: authorize/authorize-settlement-batch.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Settlement batch of an Authorize.Net statement

   In this case, the first batch (01/01/2021) of the year belongs to the settlement of 12/31/2020,
   so the **opening** settlement is from 12/31/2020.

Once the data is in the :guilabel:`Report 1 Download` sheet:

- Go to the :guilabel:`Transaction Search` tab on Authorize.Net.
- Under the :guilabel:`Settlement Date` section, select the previously used range of batch
  settlement dates in the :guilabel:`From:` and :guilabel:`To:` fields and click :guilabel:`Search`.
- When the list has been generated, click :guilabel:`Download to File`.
- In the pop-up window, select :guilabel:`Expanded Fields with CAVV Response/Comma Separated`,
  enable :guilabel:`Include Column Headings`, and click :guilabel:`Submit`.
- Open the text file, select :guilabel:`All`, copy the data, and paste it into the :guilabel:`Report
  2 Download` sheet of the :ref:`Excel import template <authorize-import-template>`.
- Transit lines are automatically filled in and updated in the :guilabel:`transit for report 1` and
  :guilabel:`transit for report 2` sheets of the :ref:`Excel import template
  <authorize-import-template>`. Make sure all entries are present, and **if not**, copy the formula
  from previously filled-in lines of the :guilabel:`transit for report 1` or :guilabel:`2` sheets
  and paste it into the empty lines.

.. important::
   To get the correct closing balance, **do not remove** any line from the Excel sheets.

Import into Odoo
----------------

To import the data into Odoo:

- Open the :ref:`Excel import template <authorize-import-template>`.
- Copy the data from the :guilabel:`transit for report 2` sheet and use *paste special* to only
  paste the values in the :guilabel:`Odoo Import to CSV` sheet.
- Look for *blue* cells in the :guilabel:`Odoo Import to CSV` sheet. These are chargeback entries
  without any reference number. As they cannot be imported as such, go to
  :menuselection:`Authorize.Net --> Account --> Statements --> eCheck.Net Settlement Statement`.
- Look for :guilabel:`Charge Transaction/Chargeback`, and click it.
- Copy the invoice description, paste it into the :guilabel:`Label` cell of the :guilabel:`Odoo
  Import to CSV` sheet, and add `Chargeback /` before the description.
- If there are multiple invoices, add a line into the :ref:`Excel import template
  <authorize-import-template>` for each invoice and copy/paste the description into each respective
  :guilabel:`Label` line.

.. note::
   For **combined chargeback/returns** in the payouts, create a new line in the :ref:`Excel import
   template <authorize-import-template>` for each invoice.

.. example::

   .. image:: authorize/authorize-chargeback-desc.png
      :alt: Chargeback description

- Next, delete *zero transaction* and *void transaction* line items, and change the format
  of the :guilabel:`Amount` column in the :guilabel:`Odoo Import to CSV` sheet to *Number*.
- Go back to :menuselection:`eCheck.Net Settlement Statement --> Search for a Transaction` and
  search again for the previously used batch settlements dates.
- Verify that the batch settlement dates on eCheck.Net match the related payments' dates found in
  the :guilabel:`Date` column of the :guilabel:`Odoo Import to CSV`.
- If it does not match, replace the date with the one from eCheck.Net. Sort the column by *date*,
  and make sure the format is `MM/DD/YYYY`.
- Copy the data - column headings included - from the :guilabel:`Odoo Import to CSV` sheet, paste
  it into a new Excel file, and save it using the CSV format.
- Open the Accounting app, go to :menuselection:`Configuration --> Journals`, tick the
  :guilabel:`Authorize.Net` box, and click :menuselection:`Favorites --> Import records --> Load
  file`. Select the CSV file and upload it into Odoo.
