Understanding Metrics
=====================
Metrics are values that help you measure progress and can be a powerful way of linking your
employees to goals.


| When you create a workflow in Odoo, its visual content already shows metrics in a graph form and
  in numbers.
| Let’s consider the example below:

| The *Target* - business object - is *Lead/Opportunity* and was narrowed down to the ones whose
  *Tag Name* contain the description “Product”, and have an email address set.
| A total number of 20 records match the criteria.

Out of those 20 records, 25 have become participants, in other words, they have matched the criteria.

Every time the system runs, updating numbers and triggering actions, it will look at the *Target*
model and check if new records have been added or modified, keeping the flow up-to-date.


.. note::
   The filter here is applied to *all* activities. Leads that lose the tag in the meantime will be
   excluded from later activities.


*Records* is a real-time number, therefore while the workflow is running, changes in opportunity
records can be made - delete, add, adjustment - updating the number of records, but not changing the
number of participants, as the metric *will not* exclude opportunities that have been set as
participants before. It will just add new ones. For this reason, the number of *Records* can be
different from the number of *Participants*.


.. tip::
   | You can also have filters applied to activities individually, under *Domain*. A useful feature
     to specify an individual filter that will only be performed if the records satisfied both
     filters, the activity and its domain one.
   | Example: for an activity sending an SMS, you could make sure a phone number is set to
     avoid triggering a SMS that would never be sent and crash.

| *Success* is the number of times the searching for participants - that match the filter(s) of that
  activity - was performed successfully in relation to the total number of participants.
| If a participant does not match the conditions, it will be added to *Rejected*.

Hovering over the graph, you can see the number of successful and rejected participants, per day,
for the last 15 days.

.. note::
   Every time a new record is added to the *Target* model, it will be automatically added to the
   workflow, and, it will start the workflow from the beginning (parent action).
