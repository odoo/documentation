Advanced Use Cases: Views
=========================

- **Case scenario 1: in Sales, show orders in a Kanban View instead of a List View.**

From the Sales page, access Studio and, under *Views*, set the *Kanban* option as the default one.

- **Case scenario 2: allow for the list of leads to be edited inline without having to switch to
  the form view.**

| On the *List View*, under *View* > *Editable*, choose between *New record on top* or *New record
  at the bottom*. This way, besides defining the order in which new records are displayed in the
  view, you are able to edit them.
| If the field is left blank, no editing is possible and records are shown based on your column
  preferences on the lead's page (front-end).
