.. important::
   - **Test on your preproduction portal** before starting to issue real invoices on the production
     ETA portal.
   - **Credentials** for preproduction and production environments are different. Make sure to
     update them on Odoo when you move from one environment to another.
   - If not done yet, fill out your company details with your company's full address, country, and
     Tax ID.

.. _egypt/e-invoicing-eta-codes:

ETA codes
~~~~~~~~~

E-invoicing works with a set of codes provided by the ETA. You can use the `ETA documentation
<https://sdk.preprod.invoicing.eta.gov.eg/codes/>`_ to code your business attributes.

Most of these codes are handled automatically by Odoo, provided that your :ref:`branches
<egypt/e-invoicing-branches>`, :ref:`customers <egypt/e-invoicing-customers>`, and :ref:`products
<egypt/e-invoicing-products>` are correctly configured.

- Company Information:

  - Company Tax ID
  - | Branch ID
    | If you have only one branch, use ``0`` as the branch code.
  - Activity type Code

- Other Information:

  - | Product Codes
    | Your company's products should be coded and matched with their **GS1** or **EGS** codes.
  - | Tax Codes
    | Most of the taxes codes are already configured on Odoo in the :guilabel:`ETA Code (Egypt)`
      field. We advise you to make sure these codes match your company's taxes.

:guilabel:`Create`.

:guilabel:`Sales`. Next, open the :menuselection:`Advanced Settings` tab and fill out the
:guilabel:`Egyptian ETA settings` section:

   must be filled out.

- :guilabel:`ETA Item code` (under the :menuselection:`Accounting` tab): if the barcode doesn't
  match your ETA item code.

.. note::
   You can edit your products by going to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Customers --> Products`.

.. _egypt/e-invoicing-usb-authentication:

USB authentication
------------------

Each person who needs to electronically sign invoices needs a specific USB key to authenticate and
send invoices to the ETA portal through an ERP.

.. note::
   You can contact the :abbr:`ETA (Egyptian Tax Authority)` or `Egypt Trust
   <https://www.egypttrust.com/>`_ to get these USB keys.
