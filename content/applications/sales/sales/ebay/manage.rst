be the Odoo **Forecast Quantity**.

The **Description Template** allows you to use templates for your listings. The
default template only use the **eBay Description** field of the product. You can
use html inside the **Description Template** and in the **eBay Description**.

To use pictures in your listing, you need to add them as **Attachments** on the product template.

Price** as **Listing Type**, the eBay form is sligthly different. In the
variants array, you can choose which variant will be listed on eBay as well as
set the price and the quantity for each variant.

Product Identifiers
===================

Products identifiers such as EAN, UPC, Brand or MPN are required in most of the eBay category.
The module manages the EAN and UPC identifiers with the **Barcode** field of the product variant.
If the **Barcode** field is empty or is value is not valid, the EAN and UPC values will be set as 'Does not apply' as recommended by eBay.
The Brand and MPN values are working as item specifics and should be define in the **Variants** tab on the product form.
If theses values are not set, 'Does not apply' will be used for the eBay listing.
