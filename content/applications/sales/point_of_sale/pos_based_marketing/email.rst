Email Marketing
===============

In Point of Sale, we use the emails stored in PoS orders for email marketing purposes.

.. note::
    - Basic email marketing can be done without an Email Marketing App.
    - For more advanced email marketing, an email marketing app can be used to track marketing campaigns.

Flow of Email Marketing:
========================

-  After creating an order with contact details, the user needs to select orders from the PoS orders list view.
-  Then the user has to open the server action menu and click on the :guilabel:`Send Email` action.
