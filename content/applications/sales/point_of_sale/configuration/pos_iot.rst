IoT system connection
=====================

To connect the POS with an :doc:`IoT system </applications/general/iot>`:

#. Make sure both the Point of Sale and Internet of Things (IoT) apps are installed on your
   database.
#. Set up the :doc:`/applications/general/iot/iot_box` or
   :doc:`/applications/general/iot/windows_iot`.
#. Connect the peripheral devices to the IoT system:

      :header-rows: 1
      :stub-columns: 1

      * - Device
        - Instructions
      * - Printer
        - Connect a supported receipt printer to a :abbr:`USB (Universal Serial Bus)` port or
          to the network, and power it on. Refer to :doc:`../restaurant/kitchen_printing`.
      * - Cash drawer
        - The cash drawer should be connected to the printer with an RJ25 cable.
      * - Barcode scanner
        - The barcode scanner must end barcodes with an `ENTER` character (keycode 28) in order for
          the barcode scanner to be compatible. This is most likely the barcode scanner's default
          configuration.
      * - Scale
        - Connect the scale and power it on. Refer to :doc:`/applications/general/iot/devices/scale`.
      * - Customer display
        - Connect a screen to the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box to display the :abbr:`PoS
          (Point of Sale)` order. Refer to :doc:`/applications/general/iot/devices/screen`.
      * - Payment terminal
        - The connection process depends on the terminal. Refer to the :doc:`payment terminals
          documentation </applications/sales/point_of_sale/payment_methods>`.

#. :doc:`Connect the IoT system to your Odoo database </applications/general/iot/connect>`.
#. :ref:`Access the POS settings <configuration/settings>` and select your POS, or click the
   vertical ellipsis button (:guilabel:`â‹®`) on a POS card and click :guilabel:`Edit`. Scroll down
   to the :guilabel:`Connected Devices` section, enable :guilabel:`IoT Box`, then select the devices
   to be used for the POS. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

.. tip::
   Click :guilabel:`IoT Devices` to access the list of :doc:`/applications/general/iot/devices` for
   your POS and view their connection status. Click a card to access the device's form.
