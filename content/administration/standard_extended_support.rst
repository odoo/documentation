Odoo provides **standard support** for all major versions for three years. It includes helpdesk
support, bug fixing, and security updates.

Beyond those three years, you can benefit from **extended support** by paying an extra fee. It
includes helpdesk support and bug fixes (depending on feasibility).

.. note::
   - Odoo releases intermediary versions, called online or SaaS versions, every two to three months.
     These versions are only available on Odoo Online and are not eligible for extended support.
   - You can `upgrade <https://upgrade.odoo.com>`_ from any version.

The table below shows the support status of every version. Major releases are highlighted in bold.
