E-invoicing integration with MyInvois
=====================================

The MyInvois Portal is a platform provided by the :abbr:`IRBM (Inland Revenue Board of Malaysia)`
that facilitates the implementation of e-invoices for Malaysian taxpayers.
Odoo supports integration with MyInvois to submit the invoices generated in Odoo.

.. note::
   The :guilabel:`Malaysia - E-invoicing module` must be installed to submit invoices to MyInvois.

Set-up
------

MyInvois registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To send electronic invoices to MyInvois, you first need to register and log in to the MyInvois

.. note::
   If this is the first time you log into the MyInvois portal, click :guilabel:`User Manual` on
   MyTax_ to learn more about the registration process. Both the **pre-production** (:dfn:`testing
   environment to try the functions before using the actual (production) environment`) and
   **production** (:dfn:`actual environment to submit e-invoices with accurate information`)
   environments are supported.

#. Log into MyTax_. Choose the :guilabel:`ID Type` and the corresponding
