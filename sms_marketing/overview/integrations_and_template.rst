Integrations and Templates

Using SMS to reach people can be a strategy not just used for advertisement purposes but also as a
reminder of events or issued invoices to your costumers, for example.


Organize Email Marketing and SMS Campaigns
==========================================
First, make sure to have the necessary feature activated. Go to the :menuselection:`Email Marketing
app --> Configuration --> Settings --> activate the option Mailing Campaigns`.

Now, you will also have the menu *Campaigns* included in your *SMS Marketing* page, allowing you
to have an overview of your SMS mailings and your email marketing ones.

This feature is especially useful if you have aggregated campaigns, as you have a global reporting
view. In addition to that, you can create stages in your kanban view to better organize the work
being done.

Sending SMSs through the Contacts app
=====================================
| Sending SMSs through the contactâ€™s form is available by default in Odoo. It makes your work easier
  if you need to send an SMS to a specific contact, for example.
| For that, go to the *Contacts* app, select the contact and click on the *SMS* icon next to the
  phone number.

:menuselection:`List View --> select all the contacts --> Action --> Send SMS`.
