Create a custom background shape
================================

Shapes are decorative elements that can be applied to backgrounds or images. They are SVG files
that can be animated and customized with different colors.

#. To better align with the website's desired atmosphere, create a custom background shape that the
   client can reuse on different blocks.

   Create your custom shape using the following setup:

   - Declare your shape. You can find the original `SVG shape here
     <{GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/shape-waves.svg>`_.
   - Set the base color of the shape to the theme's green, and add it to the list of available
     shapes.

.. seealso::
   See reference documentation on how to add a :ref:`custom background shapes
   <website_themes/shapes/bg/custom>`.

.. tip::
   | **Be careful,** there is a trick!
   | In your shape SVG file, you have to use the colors from the default Odoo palette.
   | Here, I want it to match my primary color 1 (`#CEF8A1`). Therefore, in the SVG file, you must
     use color 3 from Odoo’s default palette (`#3AADAA`).

   Find the solution in our Airproof example for:

   - the shape declaration on `shapes.xml <{GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/data/shapes.xml>`_.
   - adding the shape to the list thanks to
     `primary_variable.scss
     <{GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/static/src/scss/primary_variables.scss>`_ and `option.xml
     <{GITHUB_TUTO_PATH}/website_airproof/views/snippets/options.xml>`_.

2. Based on the Airproof design, apply the shape you just added to a `Text-Image` building block on
   the homepage:

   - Ensure the shape is in the right position.
   - Set its color to the theme's light blue.

.. tip::
   Unlike a standard Odoo shapes, when applying a custom shape to a section, replace `web_editor`
   with `illustration` in the shape class.

Add a background gradient
=========================

Apply a custom background gradient to your ”*Latest products*” block, transitioning from blue
`rgb(11, 142, 230)` to dark blue `rgb(41, 128, 187)`.

.. _tutorials/website_theme/customisation_part2/animations:

Animations
==========

The client loves the overall design but finds the page a bit static. Enhance page interactivity with
animations such as `fade-in`, `rotate`, `bounce`, etc. These can be applied to columns, images,
texts, buttons…

Based on the airproof design, animate the following elements:

- the text of the first slide of the carousel.
- the sticker and the photo of the drone from the first slide.
- the 4 columns with icons.

Adjust animation delays for smoother transitions.

.. _tutorials/website_theme/customisation_part2/forms:

Forms
=====

The forms in Odoo are very powerful. They can send emails directly to a personal inbox or integrate
directly with other Odoo applications. This is great, as one of your client's main priorities is
after-sales service. Therefore, the contact form must be properly configured.

Based on the airproof design, create a contact page. Remember to disable the default one and add the
new page link to the menu. The client has the following requests for their contact form:

- *Name* and *email address* field.
- *Company name* field.
- *Conditional VAT* field displayed only if *Company name* is filled in.
- All fields should be mandatory, except for *Company name*.
- Form submission must trigger an email.
- After form submission, the `thank-you message` should remain visible on the contact page.

.. seealso::
   See reference documentation on how to:

     - :ref:`deactivate default pages <website_themes/pages/default>`,
     - :ref:`create a new page <website_themes/pages/theme_pages>`,
     - :ref:`add a menu item <website_themes/navigation/menu>`,
     - :doc:`create a form </developer/howtos/website_themes/forms>`.

.. tip::
   To determine the correct code for your form:

   - | Create a test page via the Website Builder.
     | Drag & drop the building block that interests you and apply the right design.
     | Use the code generated through :guilabel:`Editor HTML/SCSS`.
   - You can also find the original building block code in Odoo:
     `odoo/addons/website/views/snippets/s_website_form.xml
     <{GITHUB_PATH}/addons/website/views/snippets/s_website_form.xml>`_.
