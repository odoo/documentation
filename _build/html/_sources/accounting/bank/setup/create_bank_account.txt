Set up your new bank account
============================

In Odoo, you can manage multiple bank accounts. In this page, you will
be guided in the creation, modification or deletion of a bank or a
credit card account.

Go to the list of your bank accounts
------------------------------------

Go to :menuselection:`Configuration --> Settings --> Configure your company bank
accounts` >
The bank accounts are configured on the company information. You have to
be in the edit mode to be able to do your changes.
