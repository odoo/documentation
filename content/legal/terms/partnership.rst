| BETWEEN:
|  Odoo S.A., having its registered office at Chaussée de Namur, 40, 1367 Grand-Rosière,
|  Belgium, and its affiliates (collectively referred to as “ODOO”)
| AND:
|  _____________________________________________, a company having its registered office at
|  _____________________________________________________________________________________.
|  (hereinafter referred to as “PARTNER”)

ODOO and PARTNER are individually referred to as a "Party" and collectively referred to as
"the Parties".

1 Purpose
=========
The purpose of this agreement is to set forth the conditions under which ODOO provides services to
PARTNER, access to the Odoo Enterprise Edition software, and under which PARTNER complies with the
obligations set out hereafter.

ODOO hereby appoints PARTNER, and PARTNER hereby accepts the appointment, to be a non-exclusive partner
promoting and selling "Odoo Enterprise Edition" to customers.

PARTNER commits to doing its best effort to sell Odoo Enterprise contracts to its clients.
To support that, PARTNER will market in priority the "Odoo Enterprise Edition" version to prospects
and customers. PARTNER still has the option to sell services on other versions of the software,
like "Odoo Community Edition", should it be needed.

2 Term of the Agreement
=======================
The duration of this Agreement (the “Term”) shall be one year beginning on the date of the signature.
It is automatically renewed for an equal Term unless either party provides written notice of
termination minimum 30 days before the end of the Term to the other party.


3 Access to Odoo Enterprise Edition
===================================

3.1 Project platform access
---------------------------
To help PARTNER promote Odoo Enterprise Edition, ODOO grants PARTNER access to its project code repository
for all "Odoo Enterprise Edition" Apps, under the terms set forth in :ref:`appendix_p_a`
and the conditions restricted under this Agreement.

In addition, ODOO grants PARTNER free access to the ODOO.SH platform for testing and development
purposes.

.. _restrictions:

3.2 Restrictions
----------------
PARTNER commits to keeping confidentiality of the source code of Odoo Enterprise Edition Apps
within its staff. Access to the source code of Odoo Enterprise Edition for customers is
governed by the Odoo Enterprise Subscription Agreement.
PARTNER agrees to NOT redistribute this code to third parties without the written permission of ODOO.

PARTNER commits to not offer services on Odoo Enterprise Edition to customers who are not covered
by an Odoo Enterprise subscription, even during the implementation phase.

Notwithstanding the above, PARTNER commits to wholly preserve the integrity of the
Odoo Enterprise Edition code that is required to verify the validity of usage of Odoo Enterprise
Edition and to collect statistics that are needed for that purpose.

PARTNER is not allowed to block, restrict or limit in any way the customer's access and use of
the Odoo Enterprise Edition License, without prior consultation and written authorisation from ODOO.


4 Partnership Services
======================

4.1 Partnership levels
----------------------
The Odoo partner program consists of two types of partnerships and four levels;
“Learning Partners” is for companies who want everything necessary to start implementing Odoo,
without visibility as an official partner until they get the required experience;
“Official Partners” is for companies who want the visibility as Ready, Silver, and Gold,
according to their experience with Odoo.

Partnership level granted to PARTNER depends on the *net new Odoo Enterprise users sold* in
the last 12 months, the number of certified resources and the customer
Retention Rate. The *net new Odoo Enterprise users sold* includes new customers, upsells on existing
customer, downsells on existing customers, and customer churn.
Renewals of existing contracts do not count towards the number of Users Sold, but PARTNER
still gets a commission on these contracts as stated in section :ref:`benefits`.

The table below summarizes the requirements that have to be met for each partnership level.

The customer *Retention Rate* is calculated by dividing the total number of Odoo Enterprise customers
acquired by PARTNER in the last 3 years that are currently active by the total number of Odoo Enterprise
customers acquired by PARTNER in the last 3 years.

+--------------------------------------------+------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+

Certifications are personal, so when a certified staff member leaves or joins the company,
PARTNER must notify ODOO.

PARTNER's partnership level will be reviewed quarterly by ODOO, and adjusted
to the highest level for which the 3 requirements are met.

However, "Official Partners" may be upgraded automatically to a higher level once they reach the
3 requirements for that higher partnership level.
