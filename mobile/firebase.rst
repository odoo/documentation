Push Notifications
==================

As of Odoo 12.0, 13.0 or above, there is no more complex configuration to enable push
notifications in the mobile app.

Simply go to :menuselection:`Settings --> General Settings --> Odoo Cloud Notification (OCN)`
and make sure that **Push Notifications** is checked.
