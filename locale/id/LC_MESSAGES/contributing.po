msgid "Although chaining characters ``‣`` and menu names works fine to indicate a user which menus to click, it is best to use the ``menuselection`` directive (see :ref:`contributing/specialized-directives`) for the same result. Indeed, it renders the menus chain consistently with the rest of the documentation and would automatically adapt to the new graphic chart if we were to switch to a new one. This directive is used inline as follows: ``:menuselection:`Settings --> Products --> Variants```."
