FAQ
===

After my synchronization, no account appears
--------------------------------------------

You selected an institution from the list and did not authorize any accounts from this institution.

I have an error about that my authorization has expired
-------------------------------------------------------

Every **3 months** (90 days) you must re-authorize the connection between your bank account
and Ponto. This must be done from the `Ponto website <https://myponto.com>`_. If you do not
do this, the synchronization will stop for these accounts.

I have some errors with my beta institution
-------------------------------------------

Ponto provides institutions in *beta*, these institutions are not directly supported by Odoo
and we advise you to contact Ponto directly.

.. important::
   Using an institution in beta is beneficial for Ponto, it allows them to have real
   feedback on the connection with the institution.
