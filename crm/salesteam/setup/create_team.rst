How to create a new channel?
=========================

In the Sales module, your sales channels are accessible from the
**Dashboard** menu. If you start from a new instance, you will find a
sales channel installed by default : Direct sales. You can either start
using that default sales channel and edit it (refer to the section
*Create and Organize your stages* from the page :doc:`organize_pipeline`)
or create a new one from scratch.

To create a new channel, go to :menuselection:`Configuration --> Sales Channels` and
click on **Create**.
